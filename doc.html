                                                                <meta name="description" content="ckup. For a person with chronic degenerative conditions, which of the following should the nurse suggest for health promotion?


1. Take herbal supplements.
2. Increase physical activity.
3. Take Aleve.
4. Get a massage. - 1. Answer: 2



Rationale:
1.Although there may be some herbal supplements that can help with arthritis, this is not the best suggestion because it does not promote increased physical activity.
2. Increased physical activity in older adults promotes wellness and quality of life.
3.Medication may be helpful for relief of symptoms but does not necessarily promote increased physical activity, which can help lead to better health.
4. Massage may provide temporary relief for arthritic joints, but physical activity is what can help lead to better health.


2. Many adults find reasons or barriers for not being able to exercise. Which of the following is an example of a patient barrier?


1. Good health, no functional limitations.
2. Insurance incentive.
3. High body mass index (BMI).
4. Frequent contact with prescriber. - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.Good health, no functional limitations is an example of a patient facilitator because it is not counterintuitive to pursuing good health.
2. Insurance incentive is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides incentive for the patient.
3. High BMI is an example of a patient barrier because it is something that may seem insurmountable to a patient.
4. Frequent contact with the prescriber is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides accountability in the pursuit of good health.


3. Mr. Osorio is a 65-year-old male who recently retired because of a medical condition. He has good family support and is very motivated to start a wellness program to prevent worsening of his condition. These factors are an example of:


1. Barriers
2. Incentives
3. Positive self-efficacy
4. Facilitators - 3. Answer: 4



Rationale:
1.Barriers are things that prevent or hinder patients from exercising.
2. Incentive is one kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
3.Positive self-efficacy is another kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
4.Facilitators are things that help a patient desire exercise and health promotion, so these are facilitators.


4. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has designed programs to incorporate exercise into every patient encounter. Which of the following is the correct phrase for this program?


1. Back to Exercise
2. Health and Wellness
3. Exercise is Medicine
4. Exercise is Wellness - 4. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. Back to Exercise is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
2. Health and Wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
3. Exercise is Medicine is the correct phrase for the program the ACSM has designed to incorporate discussion of exercise into patient encounters.
4. Exercise is wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.


4. Which of the following should nurse practitioners suggest to counter common patient excuses for not exercising?


1. Join a gym.
2. Find an exercise &quot;buddy.&quot;
3. Take a 10-minute walk every day.
4. Go to the YMCA. - 5. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1.Joining a gym is not the best suggestion to counter excuses not to exercise because having to go to the gym may become another excuse. There may also be financial and transportation issues adding to the reasons not to exercise.
2. Finding an exercise &quot;buddy&quot; may be helpful but still may impose the excuse of not being able to find one.
3. Taking a 10-minute walk every day is the best suggestion. With this suggestion a patient cannot make the excuse of not having time or equipment.
4. Going to the YMCA is not the best suggestion to counter excuses for the same reasons as joining a gym is not the best suggestion.


6. Older adults who have chronic conditions and are considering an increase in their physical activity should:


1. Start slowly, using lower weights with high repetitions.
2. Consult with a personal trainer.
3. Consult a health-care provider to help set physical activity goals that are realistic and safe.
4. Start with low repetitions but heavier weights. - 6. Answer:3 



Rationale:
1. Starting slowly with low weights and high repetitions may be a good start but must be monitored or initiated by an appropriate medical professional for instruction in proper use.
2. A consultation with a personal trainer is not the best option because some trainers may not be familiar with chronic conditions.
3. Consulting a health-care provider for physical activity goals that are realistic and safe is the best option.
4. Starting with low repetitions but heavier weights is not a good way to start an exercise program because it may result in injury.


7. Challenges to increasing physical activity are different for everyone. For instance, some patients may be experiencing depression or loss, some may have had significant life changes, and others may be dealing with functional limitations. As relates to increasing physical activity, these are examples of what?


1. Patient excuses
2. Patient facilitators
3. Patient ignorance regarding what to do
4. Patient barriers - 7. Answer: 4
 
Rationale:
1.Depression, interpersonal loss, significant life event changes, and functional limitations are not choices that one makes so are not excuses.
2.Patient facilitators are things that encourage a patient to do what is needed for good health.
3.These examples are not the result of what one doesn't know.
4.These are examples of patient barriers because they discourage a patient from a desire to promote health.


8. Which of the following is the focus of additional studies about the relationship between physical activities and cognitive changes?


1. Diet and supplements
2. Provider and patients
3. Social support and patients
4. Medical conditions and medications - 8. Answer: 1




Rationale:
1. Diet and supplements are the focus of these additional studies.
2. Although provider and patient relationship is important, these are not the focus of these additional studies.
3. Although a patient's social support is important, it is not the focus of these additional studies.
4. Medical conditions and medications should be considered in physical activity, but it is not the focus of these additional studies.


9. With the recognition that baby boomers will increase the over 65 population exponentially, guidelines for increasing physical activity in older adults have been issued. Which of the following programs is dedicated to health promotion in older adults? Select all that apply.


1. The Healthy People 2020 initiative
2. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid
3. The American Medical Association
4. The National Institute on Aging
5. The American Heart Association (AHA) - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 4




Rationale:
 1. The Healthy People 2020 initiative has several sections dedicated to health promotion for older adults.
2.The Center for Medicare and Medicaid has programs to promote wellness and quality of life in older adults.
3. The American Medical Association promotes the art and science of medicine and the betterment of public health.
4. The National Institute on Aging has programs to promote wellness and quality of life in older adults.
5. The AHA publishes the scientific guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care, which form the foundation of lifesaving protocols used by health-care professionals, companies, and hospitals in the United States and throughout the world.


10. Mr. Fekjar is diagnosed with unstable angina. Which of the following is a contraindication for exercise therapy and prevents patients from joining an exercise program?
Select all that apply.


1. Uncontrolled hypertension
2. Fibromyalgia
3. Unstable aortic aneurysm
4. Chondromalacia
5. Hypoxemia - 10. Answer: 1, 3




Rationale:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension is a medical contraindication for exercise therapy.
2. Fibromyalgia is a condition in which exercise therapy is useful for health promotion.
3. Unstable aortic aneurysm is a medical contraindication for exercise therapy.
4. Chondromalacia is an orthopedic condition in which exercise therapy is useful for health promotion.
5. Low oxygen saturation or hypoxemia is a below-normal level of oxygen in the blood, specifically in the arteries. Hypoxemia is a sign of a problem related to breathing or circulation, and may result in various symptoms, such as shortness of breath and dizziness during exercise. Though it is not a contraindication for exercise therapy, its symptoms could be a barrier.


11. Which of the following may be included in the healthy lifestyle counseling during the initial
Welcome to Medicare visit? Select all that apply.


1. Level of physical activity assessment.
2. Physical therapy consultation.
3. Referral to an herbalist.
4. Referral to a health coach.
5. Referral to an acupuncturist. - 11. Answer: 1, 2, 4




Rationale:
1 Current level of physical activity is assessed during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.
2. Physical therapy consultation may be recommended for patients with disabilities or functional limitations.
3. Referral to an herbalist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.
4. Referral to a health coach may be recommended to patients during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit to keep them engaged.
5. Referral to an acupuncturist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.


12. Incorporating exercise into patients' lifestyles can be effectively achieved by including which of the following in your discussions with patients? Select all that apply.


1. Talking about the importance of exercise.
2. Encouraging goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient.
3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home.
4. Informing the patient about resources that are available in the community for group exercise.
5. Giving an illustration of the exercises. - 12. Answer: 2, 4




Rationale:
1.Handing a program or exercise prescription to the patient is more effective than just talking about it.
2.Goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient is very effective in persuading the patient to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home may not be the best approach for different reasons, such as financial ability.
4. Informing patients about the resources that are available in the community for group exercise is a valuable adjunct to counseling.
5. Though not listed as something that could promote exercise, giving the patient illustrations for the exercise could be helpful when it is demonstrated and explained.


13. The goal of increasing physical activity is to promote a healthy lifestyle. Which of the following options help reduce the risk of injuries? Select all that apply.


1. Choosing physical activities that are appropriate for their current fitness level and health goals.
2. Remaining under the care of a health-care provider if they have chronic conditions or symptoms.
3. Choosing to do physical activities their friends are doing.
4. Enlisting spousal supervision and support.
5. Hiring a personal trainer. - 13. Answer: 1, 2




Rationale:
1.Choosing to do types of physical activities that are appropriate for a patient's current fitness level and health goals helps reduce the risk of injuries.
2. Being under the care of a health-care provider if a patient has chronic conditions or symptoms helps reduce the risk of injuries.
3. Choosing to do types of physical activities one's friends are doing is not the best option in reducing risk for injuries because of differences in physical ability or medical conditions.
4. Being under the supervision of one's spouse for support is a good facilitator, but it is not the best option in reducing the risk for injures because a spouse may not understand the impact of physical activity on physical and medical conditions.
5. A personal trainer may not have the proper training for more complicated conditions.


14. The AHA Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism identified patient facilitators to increasing physical activity in older adults. Which of the following is an example of patient facilitators? Select all that apply.
1. Frequent contact with prescriber.
2. Planned program.
3. Making time.
4. Purchasing new equipment.
5. Ignorance of exercise. - 14. Answer: 1,2 



Rationale:
1.Frequent contact with a prescriber has been seen to be a patient facilitator.
2. A planned program has resulted in facilitation toward health motivation.
3. Making time is a patient choice rather than a facilitator toward making changes.
4. Purchasing new equipment is not an example of a patient facilitator and may not be doable for all patients.
5.Ignorance of what to do is not a patient facilitator but a barrier to increasing physical activities.


15. To perform physical activity safely and reduce the risk of injuries and other adverse events, which of the following are advisable? Select all that apply.


1. Start fast to get acclimated to the activities.
2. Use their instincts.
3. Use appropriate protective gear.
4. Follow rules and policies.
5. Have an exercise &quot;buddy.&quot; - 15. Answer: 3, 4




Rationale:
1.Starting fast could actually increase the possibility of injury.
2.There is no guarantee that instincts are correct.
3.Using appropriate protective gear is recommended to reduce the risk of injuries.
4.Rules and policies are made to inform and protect, therefore, following them will help to reduce the risk of injuries.
5.Having an exercise &quot;buddy&quot; may make the activity fun but will not necessarily reduce risk of injuries, especially if the buddy does not understand the concepts of exercises and physical activity physiology.


1. Mrs. Smith, 75 years old, reports that she is weak, has difficulty urinating, and is dehydrated. Although she is afebrile, the nurse conducts a thorough physical examination, including urinalysis and complete blood count (CBC). The total assessment is necessary because:
1. All body systems interact, and symptoms could indicate a variety of diagnoses.
2. The symptoms are vague and may be signs of aging.
3. There may be other signs or symptoms more indicative of the condition.
4. Mrs. Smith may not be reporting all significant information. - 1. Answer: 1


Rationale:
1.The clinician must be aware that all the systems interact and, in doing so, can increase the older person's vulnerability to illness/disease.
2.The nurse must not attribute symptoms only to the aging process.
3. There may be comorbidities accompanying this condition.
4. Assumptions of not reporting properly may not be true.


2. A patient with renal disease has blood work drawn, and the results show an increase in serum creatinine. The nurse practitioner needs to know which of the following laboratory values before ordering medications?


1. CBC
2. Culture and sensitivity of the urine
3. Creatinine clearance
4. Uric acid levels - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.A CBC will not evaluate kidney function for a patient with renal disease.
2.A culture and sensitivity test reflects the presence of an infection and the antibiotic to which the organism is sensitive.
3. The calculation of creatinine clearance provides an estimation of renal function.
4. Uric acid level is elevated in the presence of gout.


3. Which of the following statements is true regarding diagnostic testing?


1. A test is ordered for a specific purpose.
2. A test is the most invasive available.
3. There is no need to discuss results with the patient.
4. If a test is needed, it should be ordered regardless of risk to the patient. - 3. Answer:1 



Rationale:
1. The nurse practitioner should have a plan for the use of each test result value obtained.
2. When considering which laboratory tests to order, it is worth remembering the doctrine primum no nnocere—first, do no harm.
3. Once laboratory tests are available for review, tests results should be discussed with the patient, with abnormal test results interpreted for the aging individual and addressed with the patient and caregivers.
4. Any risks involved in laboratory testing must be considered concerning the patient's clinical condition and weighed against the test's expected benefits.


4. Janey, 25 years old, may experience arthritis differently than 65-year-old Mrs. Johnson because:


1. The body undergoes physiological changes with aging.
2. A healthy body does not experience significant changes as one gets older.
3. Older patients do not feel any systemic symptoms, such as malaise and weight loss.
4. Even though the same joints are usually affected, age makes it feel different. - 4. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the advanced practice nurse in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.
2. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may be different depending on the age of the patient.
3. Younger patients may not experience constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.
4. In late-onset rheumatoid arthritis, the joint involvement is more often in the larger joints.


5. The nurse practitioner is examining an 85-year-old man with reports of abdominal pain, weakness, and loss of appetite. Which is the most likely condition to be tested for and ruled out?


1. Neoplasms and carcinomas
2. Partial seizure
3. Sarcopenia
4. Hirschsprung's disease - 5. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Certain diseases, such as neoplasms and carcinomas, are more common in the elderly, and an understanding of the epidemiology is critical in the interpretation.
2.Partial seizure is more common in early old age.
3. Sarcopenia is more common in early old age.
4. Hirschsprung's disease is most common in infancy.


6. For individuals over 65 years old, the most common morbidities are related to:


1. Heart disease, arthritis
2. Respiratory problems, cancer
3. Diabetes, stroke
4. All of these are common morbidities. - 6. Answer: 4




Rationale:
1.Heart disease is one of the common morbidities.
2.Cancer is common in the general population; however, specific types are more common in the older patient.
3. Diabetes is common in patients over 40 years of age.
4. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined are the most common morbidities in older patients.


7. A gerontological patient is being examined for a report of pain in the shoulder. The nurse practitioner completes a thorough systemic examination because:


1. Older patients with one morbidity often express difficulties in general.
2. Arthritis of the shoulder is accompanied by other neurological symptoms.
3. Older patients with arthritis often experience pain in lower extremities.
4. The patient may not report significant signs and symptoms. - 7. Answer:1 



Rationale:
1. Older patients with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis experience joint involvement more often in the larger joints, such as the shoulder, and they also experience systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.
2. Older patients may express symptoms in any other physical systems.
3. Patients more often experience arthritis in smaller joints.
4. A thorough examination will detect objective indicators.


8. The nurse practitioner performs a thorough systemic examination of a patient who reports diarrhea and pain in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. One possible diagnosis would be:


1. Hirschsprung's disease
2. Pancreatitis
3. Appendicitis
4. Gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease (GIBD) - 8. Answer:4 



Rationale:
1. Hirschsprung's disease is an obstruction of the colon in infancy.
2. Diarrhea is not associated with pancreatitis.
3.Appendicitis is more common in younger patients than in older patients.
4. GIBD is manifested differently in a bimodal pattern.

9. A 70-year-old man is seeing a nurse practitioner because he is feeling weak and dizzy. The nurse practitioner is discussing a care plan with him and makes which of the following statements? Select all that apply.


1. I want to order a test for your heart to evaluate its function.
2. I will perform a thorough examination of your functional abilities.
3. I will order a blood sugar test to check for diabetes.
4. Many older people feel this way. It is to be expected.
5. I will assess you for the presence of other conditions. - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 5



Rationale:
1. A complete assessment will help differentiate signs of aging from disease.
2. All systems interact and can affect an existing condition.
3. Identifying underlying conditions will avoid undertreatment.
4. Attributing symptoms to aging can contribute to depression in an older person.
5. There are changes in the sympathetic response which contribute to the orthostasis and falls, as well as lack of hypoglycemic response.


10. The nurse practitioner is leading a class of seniors over age 65 years and is teaching about nutritional needs. One of the men asks why, even though he eats correctly according to the standards presented, he still feels weaker than he did 10 years ago. He also wonders why he gets more infections than he used to. Which of the following are helpful answers? Select all that apply.


1. I suggest that you exercise a little more than you are currently doing.
2. Some people experience a decrease in reserve energy.
3. For some people, the immune system weakens.
4. More viruses are being spread throughout the community.
5. I suggest that you see your primary caregiver for extensive testing. - 10. Answer: 2, 3, 5 , 3



Rationale:
1. Improved nutrition may not be the factor affecting health of elders.
2. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including lifestyle and medications.
3. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including changes in the immune system.
4. Viruses and other infections are not the only considerations for infections.
5. Biochemical individuality is important in detecting asymptomatic abnormalities in older adults. Significant homeostatic disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests, even though all individual test results may lie within normal limits of the reference interval for the entire group.


11. An older woman is seen in the ambulatory clinic for a routine checkup. The patient asks about results of her blood work compared to last year's results. How is it best for the clinician to respond? Select all that apply.


1. They are likely to be the same if you have had no diseases since then.
2. Blood work results may be different just because of your aging process.
3. Your results may be different because the body changes with disease and medications you are taking.
4. Blood work is not a reliable indicator of health because many things can affect your health that may not show up in the results of your blood work.
5. There is likely no significant difference as your body remains stable in its functioning. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 5



Rationale:
1.Biochemical individuality variation is often much smaller than variation within the larger group.
2. The aging process and decline in organ function may affect the health of elders.
3. Disease, nutrition, and medications affect the health of elders.
4. Although abnormal laboratory findings are often attributed to old age, rarely are they true aging changes.
5. Many factors can influence laboratory value interpretation in the elderly, including the physiological changes with aging, the prevalence of chronic disease, changes in nutritional and fluid intake, lifestyle (including activity), and the medications that are taken.


12. An elderly couple is discussing health concerns with the nurse practitioner. The couple is concerned that each of their individual blood studies show different results. One set of test results shows a significant decrease in blood sugar, but the test results of the partner does not show an equal
 
decrease. Their physician does not seem concerned, and the couple is wondering why. How is it best for the nurse practitioner to respond? Select all that apply.


1. Studies show that each person's pattern of chemical make-up is different.
2. There is no difference between one person's range of blood results and that of any other person.
3. Each person's chemical make-up is the same as that of others of the same gender and age group.
4. Many factors affect an individual's chemical make-up.
5. Ranges of the values provided by the laboratory are correct for any age. - 12. Answer: 1, 4, 3



Rationale:
1. Individuals experience smaller variations in laboratory work than from the others in the same age group.
2.There are wider variations of laboratory results within a group of older people.
3.Laboratory values are determined by more than age and gender.
4.Laboratory values may vary as a result of nutrition, activity, and emotional status.
5.The reference values presented for the older adult cohort are not necessarily correct for the individual due to biochemical individuality.


13. Adam, 70 years old, is admitted for possible myasthenia gravis (MG). The nurse practitioner knows that MG is commonly seen in women between 20 and 40 years old. Adam, however, is experiencing an ocular form of MG, has dysphonia, and does not have any thymus abnormalities. Adam asks why the nurse is concerned about MG since he is older and this is a &quot;young person's disease.&quot; Which of the following are the best answers? Select all that apply.


1. We need to assess for anything, just in case.
2. Some diseases show up in two different age and gender groups.
3. Older people often experience weakness, and we must rule out other conditions.
4. Your insurance will cover this, and we want to rule out as much as possible.
5. Signs and symptoms of illness are the same for each disease regardless of age. - 13. Answer: 2, 3




Rationale:
1.Ordering more tests than needed violates the principle of &quot;Do no harm.&quot;
2.MG is bimodal and can be found in younger women, as well as in both men and women.
 
3. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the nurse practitioner in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.
4. There should be a need for ordering a test and value attributed to the results.

14. Mrs. Smith is 75 years old and has had type 2 diabetes for 30 years. She sees her nurse practitioner on a regular basis. Mrs. Smith asks the nurse practitioner why her treatment has not been changed, even though her laboratory values are seemingly out of normal range. Which of the following answers are best? Select all that apply.


1. A decision to make changes must be based on a pattern and not on one set of laboratory results.
2. The normal range charts are based on patients younger than 75 years.
3. Currently, it is too expensive to change your treatment.
4. Comparing new results with your prior results gives a more accurate picture.
5. Normal values for laboratory tests differ as one gets older. - 14. Answer: 1, 4, 5




Rationale:
1.Blood studies are more valuable when assessing for an increase or decrease in values.
2. It is not helpful to use aging as an explanation for possible abnormal results.
3. If a change in treatment is appropriate, the least expensive alternative should be sought.
4. Significant disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests.
5. The clinician must determine whether a value obtained reflects a normal aging change, a disease, or the potential for disease.


15. Mr. Adams is 90 years old. In the last few months he appears unable to comply with the health- care plan developed by the nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner considers which of the following reasons for noncompliance when updating his home care plan? Select all that apply.

3. Stretching routines are done slowly and to the level of endurance.
4. When the frail older person cannot ambulate, they can move other parts of their body such as core, arms, head, and neck. They may also do non-weight-bearing movements of legs and feet.
5. Movement, activity, and exercise can be done anywhere, anytime the individual desires. There is no need to join a group.


11. Nutrition counseling is part of health promotion. The nurse practitioner considers a teaching plan that includes which of the following information? Select all that apply.


1. Level of involvement in community activities.
2. Baseline information on current dietary intake.
3. Current activity patterns.
4. Current height and weight.
5. Health status information. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 4, 5



Rationale:
1. Active involvement in community activities does not reflect what the older person is eating.
2. The nurse practitioner needs the current state of nutrition to develop a plan for increasing or maintaining positive nutrition.
3. Knowing how much activity the person has affects the need for calories and nutrients.
4. Knowing the current height and weight aids in determining the body mass index, which is an indicator of normal weight or overweight.

5. Urinary incontinence. - 12. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4,5 



Rationale:
1. Possession of a firearm combined with depression, caregiver stress, irreversible illness, or decline in functional abilities can invite self-inflicted injury, suicide pacts, or other acts of violence.
2. Fear of falling causes a person to walk guardedly and unevenly.
3. Potential recommendations include exercise programs to build strength.
4. Rugs, furniture, and pets can become obstacles for the older person to stumble over.
5. Urinary incontinence, day or night, causes the person to rush to the bathroom and increases the risk of falling.


13. Albert is 72 years old and complains of burning upon urination. He has recently returned from a vacation to another country. The nurse practitioner conducts a physical examination and observes that there is a white discharge from his penis. What does the nurse practitioner include in the treatment plan? Select all that apply.

3. Teaching that frequent testing and screening is needed if he continues to be sexually active.
4. Assuring the patient that while traveling there are limited opportunities for sexual encounters.
5. There is no need to assess an older patient's sexual preferences and practices. - 13. Answer: 1, 2, 3

Rationale:
1. Older adults are less likely to practice safe sex and use condoms.
2. Older people may be at increased danger from STIs because of the decreased perception of risk.
3. Current sexual history may determine the need for continued screening for STIs, HPV, and cervical cancer.
4. Encounters may be with fellow travelers, locals, or commercial sex workers.
5. Using the patient's sexual history, explore patient needs, preferences, and medical or psychological obstacles to sexual expression.


14. Mary, 72 years old, goes to the pharmacy to pick up her prescriptions. The pharmacist asks if she has had her immunizations. Mary replies, &quot;I had all my childhood shots, so I do not need any now.&quot; What should the nurse practitioner teach her about senior immunizations? Select all that apply.


1. Because the immune system may be weakened in older persons, immunizations are suggested.
2. Persons over the age of 50 years should have a yearly influenza vaccine.
3. The new Shingrix vaccine will help protect her from shingles.
4. The side effects of immunizations outweigh the benefits of immunizations.
5. The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a one-time dose. - 14. Answer: 1, 2, 3



Rationale:
1. The older person is susceptible to organisms that cause infection due to decreased immunity, nutrition, hydration, and other factors.
2. The influenza virus mutates each year and an updated version of the vaccine is needed to provide immunity. Influenza vaccine is now recommended annually for all adults over 50 years old, unless contraindicated.
3. Recently released Shingrix has been found to be more effective than the Zostavax, which was given previously.
4. Side effects are most often mild and localized. Viruses can cause serious or even lethal conditions.
5. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended as follows: Administer one-time dose to PCV13-naïve adults at age 65 years, followed by a dose of PPSV23 12 months later.


15. Mr. and Mrs. Jones are preparing to take a trip to Europe. The nurse practitioner includes the following teaching about taking care of their health while gone. Select all that apply.


1. Shorter airplane flights provide more chance to ambulate and relieve pressure on the back and legs.
2. Generally speaking, the air in Europe is cleaner than the air in the United States, so you should have no problems with your respiratory conditions.
3. Plan to fill your prescriptions when you are in a larger city.
4. Depending on the specific areas you will visit, certain immunizations may be needed.
5. You will most likely function as well when traveling as when at home. - 15. Answer: 1, 4
,



Rationale:
1. Long flights in cramped areas increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
2. Increased air pollution is a significant problem in many countries and affects pulmonary function.
3. The medications needed may not be available in some countries in Europe. Medicare does not cover medications filled outside of the United States.
4. Some areas of the world continue to see cases of yellow fever, malaria, and other diseases. When going to a vulnerable area, proper immunizations are required.
5. Some of the physiological and psychosocial changes that can occur with aging pose special risks during travel. How a patient functions at home may not be indicative of how well he or she will function in an unfamiliar environment.




1. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both 75 years old and are seeing their nurse practitioner for their annual checkups. Mrs. Smith wonders why they each have trouble digesting different foods. It is inconvenient for her to fix different meals that they both can tolerate. The nurse practitioner explains that:


1. Men have more difficulty digesting vegetables.
2. Women have more difficulty digesting dairy products.

2. The nurse practitioner conducts a comprehensive geriatric assessment of the older individual because:


1. Health of older people is affected by several factors.
2. A focused assessment will provide depth of specific information.
3. A comprehensive assessment will provide more subjective information.
4. A comprehensive assessment will result in a list of current and prior medications taken. - 2. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. A comprehensive approach to geriatric assessment is recommended because the physical health of the older adult is inextricably related to functional ability, psychosocial health, and a safe and enabling environment.
2. A focused assessment will provide a limited amount of information about the whole person.
3. A comprehensive assessment will provide both objective and subjective information.
4. A list of medications is only one component of a comprehensive assessment.


3. The nurse practitioner knows that conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is more beneficial for which of the following groups?


1. People between 60 and 70 years old.
2. People over 70 years old.

4. People over 55 years old. - 3. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.People between 60 and 70 years old are likely to be healthy.
2. People over 70 years old have a variety of levels of health.
3. Vulnerable older adults and frail older adults will benefit most from a CGA because of lower physiological reserves and higher risk of iatrogenic complications.
4. People over 55 years old may not be considered the appropriate age for a CGA.


4. A family member comes into the clinician's office with her older mother, the patient. In the process of the examination, the nurse practitioner identifies the patient as &quot;frail older adult.&quot; The family member asks what that means. The nurse practitioner explains that this refers to:

2. Acquire information about past medical conditions.
3. Determine which diagnostic tests are necessary.
4. Satisfy requirements of Medicare. - 5. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. The CGA is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary, and diagnostic process to identify needs and plan outcomes.
2. The CGA includes information from medical history, as well as the current assessment.
3. The CGA helps identify diagnostics, treatments, and other plan-of-care strategies.
4. The CGA is not a requirement of Medicare.


6. Mary Jane is seeing a nurse practitioner for a CGA and asks which parts of her life will be examined. The nurse practitioner says the domains of the CGA include:


1. Internal organ health.
2. Social habits.
3. Physical and psychological health, as well as other facets of life.
4. History of family illness. - 6. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. The CGA includes more than internal health.
2. Learning about social habits is not the only component in determining health.
3. Domains of CGA include physical health, psychological health, socio-environmental supports, mobility, functional status, and a measure of the quality of life.
4. Although family health history provides information about genetics, the CGA is complete and includes current health status in several domains.


7. In conducting a CGA, the nurse practitioner looks for any impairments in communication with the patient. The assessment includes:


1. Interviewing prior to the physical examination.
2. Asking questions of the accompanying family member.
3. Reading the history forms provided by the patient after the examination.
4. Observing physical impairments. - 7. Answer: 1


Rationale:
1. Interviewing begins before the physical examination and continues throughout the examination.
2. Permission from the patient must be obtained before discussing anything with the family member.
3. When forms about the history of the patient are brought in, the nurse practitioner should review them before the examination.
4. Observation alone will not provide adequate information about communication impairments.


8. When an assessment is conducted, which of the following needs to be recorded when a new concern is identified? Select all that apply.


1. Location and radiation.
2. Quantity and quality.
3. Aggravating and alleviating.

9. After examining Adam, who is 79 years old, the nurse practitioner uses which of the following criteria to adjust Adam's medications? Select all that apply.


1. The Beers Criteria published in 1991
2. Medication Appropriateness Index
3. STOPP/START Criteria
4. HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications
5. Hospital formulary - 9. Answer: 2, 3



Rationale:
1. The Beers Criteria, 1991, was revised in 2015. Other criteria were also developed to address weaknesses found in the original Beers Criteria.
2. The Medications Appropriateness Test was developed to address some of the weak areas of the Beers
Criteria.
3. The STOPP/START Criteria were developed to determine when medications should be added and when another might be discontinued for an older patient.
4. The HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications does not guide in medication prescribing.
5. Hospital formulary provides a list of medications carried within that hospital.


10. While examining John, who is 80 years old, the nurse practitioner observes that as he rises from the chair he pauses and holds on to the rail. Asking John if this happens often, he replies, &quot;Yes, I get lightheaded and feel like I will fall.&quot; The nurse practitioner decides to conduct testing for orthostatic hypotension. This test includes which of the following? Select all that apply.


1. Having the patient lie down for 5 minutes, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.
2. Having the patient stand and wait a minute, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.
3. Having the patient jump in place for 2 minutes and then lie down.
4. Having the patient breathe deeply five times and then stand up.
5. Having the patient get up from his chair without using his arms, walk two to three steps, then back up to his chair and sit down. - 10. Answer: 1, 2


Rationale:
1.Obtaining baseline blood pressures is important to assess any changes.
2. Measuring the blood pressure after John gets up will show a drop if he experiences hypostatic hypotension.
3.Jumping in place is not a normal activity and is risky for older people.
4.Breathing deeply does not affect blood pressure significantly.
5.Mobility can be screened with the Timed Get Up and Go Test. This test involves observing for unsteadiness as the patient gets up from a chair without using the arms, walks 10 feet, turns around, walks back, and resumes a seated position.


11. In conducting a physical assessment of an older person, the nurse practioner assesses which of the following? Select all that apply.


1. Pulse oximetry
2. Weight
3. Color of hair
4. Functional assessment
5. Presence of pain - 11. Answer: 1, 2, 4, 5

2. Visual acuity worse than 20/40.
3. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze.
4. Ability to gaze downward.
5. Absence of nystagmus. - 12. Answer: 2, 3,

 
Rationale:
1. An acuity of 20/20 is normal. Better than that is good.
2. Visual acuity of worse than 20/40 suggests weakness in the ability to see.
3. Abnormality in cardinal fields of gaze may indicate a neurological condition.
4. Ability to gaze downward is normal.
5. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze with nystagmus or lack of a downward gaze may reveal neurological disease.


13. Bertha is an 85-year-old grandmother who has multiple morbidities. Family members report that Bertha is not eating much and does not seem as active as usual.

1. Geriatric assessments can be challenging for the health-care provider due to delay of
recognition and/or reporting of symptoms by the patient. Which of the following best describes what is used by health-care providers to address this differential?


1. Clinical decision-making tools.
2. When symptoms were noticed.
3. Change in function and impact of symptoms.
4. Symptoms from comorbidities. - 1. Answer: 3
4



Rationale:
1. Using clinical decision-making tools can be complicated because of different factors, such as patient denial of symptoms and their occurrences.
2. Using the time symptoms were noticed as the basis for assessment cannot be deemed an effective tool due to inaccuracies regarding the report of when symptoms first occurred.
3. Change in function as a measure of the impact of a symptom on the patient is an effective means of sorting out the differential.
4. Comorbidities can result in a delayed or atypical presentation.


2. Which of the following terms refers to conditions that have multiple underlying factors and may involve multiple organs?


1. Multifaceted syndrome
2. Aging syndrome

6. Tina is a 60-year-old female presenting symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum. She is being treated with antibiotics, use of a nebulizer, and oral steroids. Which of the following conditions could be her diagnosis?


1. Bacterial pneumonia
2. Acute bronchitis
3. Chronic bronchitis
4. GERD - 6. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.
Her symptoms are not typical of bacterial pneumonia, which is a common lung infection where the lungs' air sacks become inflamed. Signal symptoms may be fever as high as 105°F, along with profuse sweating, bluish lips and nails, and confusion.
2.
Antibiotics should not be used with acute bronchitis because it is viral.
3.
 
Chronic bronchitis is a condition that presents with symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum, and is often treated with antibiotics, use of a nebulizer, and oral steroids.
4.
GERD is a gastrointestinal condition that may be associated with coughing but is treated with an antihistamine and decongestant.


7. Reduction of pain is the main goal for patients suffering from acute joint pain. The mnemonic
PRICE is a helpful reminder of the treatment when this occurs. What does the &quot;E&quot; in PRICE stand for?


1. Elevation

1. Take herbal supplements.
2. Increase physical activity.
3. Take Aleve.
4. Get a massage. - 1. Answer: 2



Rationale:
1.Although there may be some herbal supplements that can help with arthritis, this is not the best suggestion because it does not promote increased physical activity.
2. Increased physical activity in older adults promotes wellness and quality of life.
3.Medication may be helpful for relief of symptoms but does not necessarily promote increased physical activity, which can help lead to better health.
4. Massage may provide temporary relief for arthritic joints, but physical activity is what can help lead to better health.


2. Many adults find reasons or barriers for not being able to exercise. Which of the following is an example of a patient barrier?


1. Good health, no functional limitations.
2. Insurance incentive.
3. High body mass index (BMI).
4. Frequent contact with prescriber. - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.Good health, no functional limitations is an example of a patient facilitator because it is not counterintuitive to pursuing good health.
2. Insurance incentive is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides incentive for the patient.
3. High BMI is an example of a patient barrier because it is something that may seem insurmountable to a patient.
4. Frequent contact with the prescriber is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides accountability in the pursuit of good health.


3. Mr. Osorio is a 65-year-old male who recently retired because of a medical condition. He has good family support and is very motivated to start a wellness program to prevent worsening of his condition. These factors are an example of:


1. Barriers
2. Incentives
3. Positive self-efficacy
4. Facilitators - 3. Answer: 4



Rationale:
1.Barriers are things that prevent or hinder patients from exercising.
2. Incentive is one kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
3.Positive self-efficacy is another kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
4.Facilitators are things that help a patient desire exercise and health promotion, so these are facilitators.


4. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has designed programs to incorporate exercise into every patient encounter. Which of the following is the correct phrase for this program?


1. Back to Exercise
2. Health and Wellness
3. Exercise is Medicine
4. Exercise is Wellness - 4. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. Back to Exercise is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
2. Health and Wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
3. Exercise is Medicine is the correct phrase for the program the ACSM has designed to incorporate discussion of exercise into patient encounters.
4. Exercise is wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.


4. Which of the following should nurse practitioners suggest to counter common patient excuses for not exercising?


1. Join a gym.
2. Find an exercise &quot;buddy.&quot;
3. Take a 10-minute walk every day.
4. Go to the YMCA. - 5. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1.Joining a gym is not the best suggestion to counter excuses not to exercise because having to go to the gym may become another excuse. There may also be financial and transportation issues adding to the reasons not to exercise.
2. Finding an exercise &quot;buddy&quot; may be helpful but still may impose the excuse of not being able to find one.
3. Taking a 10-minute walk every day is the best suggestion. With this suggestion a patient cannot make the excuse of not having time or equipment.
4. Going to the YMCA is not the best suggestion to counter excuses for the same reasons as joining a gym is not the best suggestion.


6. Older adults who have chronic conditions and are considering an increase in their physical activity should:


1. Start slowly, using lower weights with high repetitions.
2. Consult with a personal trainer.
3. Consult a health-care provider to help set physical activity goals that are realistic and safe.
4. Start with low repetitions but heavier weights. - 6. Answer:3 



Rationale:
1. Starting slowly with low weights and high repetitions may be a good start but must be monitored or initiated by an appropriate medical professional for instruction in proper use.
2. A consultation with a personal trainer is not the best option because some trainers may not be familiar with chronic conditions.
3. Consulting a health-care provider for physical activity goals that are realistic and safe is the best option.
4. Starting with low repetitions but heavier weights is not a good way to start an exercise program because it may result in injury.


7. Challenges to increasing physical activity are different for everyone. For instance, some patients may be experiencing depression or loss, some may have had significant life changes, and others may be dealing with functional limitations. As relates to increasing physical activity, these are examples of what?


1. Patient excuses
2. Patient facilitators
3. Patient ignorance regarding what to do
4. Patient barriers - 7. Answer: 4
 
Rationale:
1.Depression, interpersonal loss, significant life event changes, and functional limitations are not choices that one makes so are not excuses.
2.Patient facilitators are things that encourage a patient to do what is needed for good health.
3.These examples are not the result of what one doesn't know.
4.These are examples of patient barriers because they discourage a patient from a desire to promote health.


8. Which of the following is the focus of additional studies about the relationship between physical activities and cognitive changes?


1. Diet and supplements
2. Provider and patients
3. Social support and patients
4. Medical conditions and medications - 8. Answer: 1




Rationale:
1. Diet and supplements are the focus of these additional studies.
2. Although provider and patient relationship is important, these are not the focus of these additional studies.
3. Although a patient's social support is important, it is not the focus of these additional studies.
4. Medical conditions and medications should be considered in physical activity, but it is not the focus of these additional studies.


9. With the recognition that baby boomers will increase the over 65 population exponentially, guidelines for increasing physical activity in older adults have been issued. Which of the following programs is dedicated to health promotion in older adults? Select all that apply.

3. Referral to an herbalist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.
4. Referral to a health coach may be recommended to patients during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit to keep them engaged.
5. Referral to an acupuncturist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.


12. Incorporating exercise into patients' lifestyles can be effectively achieved by including which of the following in your discussions with patients? Select all that apply.


1. Talking about the importance of exercise.
2. Encouraging goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient.
3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home.
4. Informing the patient about resources that are available in the community for group exercise.
5. Giving an illustration of the exercises. - 12. Answer: 2, 4




Rationale:
1.Handing a program or exercise prescription to the patient is more effective than just talking about it.
2.Goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient is very effective in persuading the patient to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home may not be the best approach for different reasons, such as financial ability.
4. Informing patients about the resources that are available in the community for group exercise is a valuable adjunct to counseling.
5. Though not listed as something that could promote exercise, giving the patient illustrations for the exercise could be helpful when it is demonstrated and explained.


13. The goal of increasing physical activity is to promote a healthy lifestyle. Which of the following options help reduce the risk of injuries? Select all that apply.


1. Choosing physical activities that are appropriate for their current fitness level and health goals.
2. Remaining under the care of a health-care provider if they have chronic conditions or symptoms.
3. Choosing to do physical activities their friends are doing.
4. Enlisting spousal supervision and support.
5. Hiring a personal trainer. - 13. Answer: 1, 2




Rationale:
1.Choosing to do types of physical activities that are appropriate for a patient's current fitness level and health goals helps reduce the risk of injuries.
2. Being under the care of a health-care provider if a patient has chronic conditions or symptoms helps reduce the risk of injuries.
3. Choosing to do types of physical activities one's friends are doing is not the best option in reducing risk for injuries because of differences in physical ability or medical conditions.
4. Being under the supervision of one's spouse for support is a good facilitator, but it is not the best option in reducing the risk for injures because a spouse may not understand the impact of physical activity on physical and medical conditions.
5. A personal trainer may not have the proper training for more complicated conditions.


14. The AHA Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism identified patient facilitators to increasing physical activity in older adults. Which of the following is an example of patient facilitators? Select all that apply.
1. Frequent contact with prescriber.
2. Planned program.
3. Making time.
4. Purchasing new equipment.
5. Ignorance of exercise. - 14. Answer: 1,2 



Rationale:
1.Frequent contact with a prescriber has been seen to be a patient facilitator.
2. A planned program has resulted in facilitation toward health motivation.
3. Making time is a patient choice rather than a facilitator toward making changes.
4. Purchasing new equipment is not an example of a patient facilitator and may not be doable for all patients.
5.Ignorance of what to do is not a patient facilitator but a barrier to increasing physical activities.


15. To perform physical activity safely and reduce the risk of injuries and other adverse events, which of the following are advisable? Select all that apply.


1. Start fast to get acclimated to the activities.
2. Use their instincts.
3. Use appropriate protective gear.

Rationale:
1.Starting fast could actually increase the possibility of injury.
2.There is no guarantee that instincts are correct.
3.Using appropriate protective gear is recommended to reduce the risk of injuries.
4.Rules and policies are made to inform and protect, therefore, following them will help to reduce the risk of injuries.
5.Having an exercise &quot;buddy&quot; may make the activity fun but will not necessarily reduce risk of injuries, especially if the buddy does not understand the concepts of exercises and physical activity physiology.


1. Mrs. Smith, 75 years old, reports that she is weak, has difficulty urinating, and is dehydrated. Although she is afebrile, the nurse conducts a thorough physical examination, including urinalysis and complete blood count (CBC). The total assessment is necessary because:
1. All body systems interact, and symptoms could indicate a variety of diagnoses.
2. The symptoms are vague and may be signs of aging.
3. There may be other signs or symptoms more indicative of the condition.
4. Mrs. Smith may not be reporting all significant information. - 1. Answer: 1


Rationale:
1.The clinician must be aware that all the systems interact and, in doing so, can increase the older person's vulnerability to illness/disease.
2.The nurse must not attribute symptoms only to the aging process.
3. There may be comorbidities accompanying this condition.
4. Assumptions of not reporting properly may not be true.


2. A patient with renal disease has blood work drawn, and the results show an increase in serum creatinine. The nurse practitioner needs to know which of the following laboratory values before ordering medications?


1. CBC
2. Culture and sensitivity of the urine
3. Creatinine clearance
4. Uric acid levels - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.A CBC will not evaluate kidney function for a patient with renal disease.
2.A culture and sensitivity test reflects the presence of an infection and the antibiotic to which the organism is sensitive.
3. The calculation of creatinine clearance provides an estimation of renal function.
4. Uric acid level is elevated in the presence of gout.


3. Which of the following statements is true regarding diagnostic testing?


1. A test is ordered for a specific purpose.
2. A test is the most invasive available.
3. There is no need to discuss results with the patient.
4. If a test is needed, it should be ordered regardless of risk to the patient. - 3. Answer:1 



Rationale:
1. The nurse practitioner should have a plan for the use of each test result value obtained.
2. When considering which laboratory tests to order, it is worth remembering the doctrine primum no nnocere—first, do no harm.
3. Once laboratory tests are available for review, tests results should be discussed with the patient, with abnormal test results interpreted for the aging individual and addressed with the patient and caregivers.
4. Any risks involved in laboratory testing must be considered concerning the patient's clinical condition and weighed against the test's expected benefits.


4. Janey, 25 years old, may experience arthritis differently than 65-year-old Mrs. Johnson because:


1. The body undergoes physiological changes with aging.
2. A healthy body does not experience significant changes as one gets older.
3. Older patients do not feel any systemic symptoms, such as malaise and weight loss.
4. Even though the same joints are usually affected, age makes it feel different. - 4. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the advanced practice nurse in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.
2. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may be different depending on the age of the patient.
3. Younger patients may not experience constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.
4. In late-onset rheumatoid arthritis, the joint involvement is more often in the larger joints.


5. The nurse practitioner is examining an 85-year-old man with reports of abdominal pain, weakness, and loss of appetite. Which is the most likely condition to be tested for and ruled out?


1. Neoplasms and carcinomas
2. Partial seizure
3. Sarcopenia
4. Hirschsprung's disease - 5. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Certain diseases, such as neoplasms and carcinomas, are more common in the elderly, and an understanding of the epidemiology is critical in the interpretation.
2.Partial seizure is more common in early old age.
3. Sarcopenia is more common in early old age.
4. Hirschsprung's disease is most common in infancy.


6. For individuals over 65 years old, the most common morbidities are related to:


1. Heart disease, arthritis
2. Respiratory problems, cancer
3. Diabetes, stroke
4. All of these are common morbidities. - 6. Answer: 4




Rationale:
1.Heart disease is one of the common morbidities.
2.Cancer is common in the general population; however, specific types are more common in the older patient.
3. Diabetes is common in patients over 40 years of age.
4. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined are the most common morbidities in older patients.


7. A gerontological patient is being examined for a report of pain in the shoulder. The nurse practitioner completes a thorough systemic examination because:


1. Older patients with one morbidity often express difficulties in general.
2. Arthritis of the shoulder is accompanied by other neurological symptoms.
3. Older patients with arthritis often experience pain in lower extremities.
4. The patient may not report significant signs and symptoms. - 7. Answer:1 



Rationale:
1. Older patients with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis experience joint involvement more often in the larger joints, such as the shoulder, and they also experience systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.
2. Older patients may express symptoms in any other physical systems.
3. Patients more often experience arthritis in smaller joints.
4. A thorough examination will detect objective indicators.


8. The nurse practitioner performs a thorough systemic examination of a patient who reports diarrhea and pain in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. One possible diagnosis would be:


1. Hirschsprung's disease
2. Pancreatitis
3. Appendicitis
4. Gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease (GIBD) - 8. Answer:4 



Rationale:
1. Hirschsprung's disease is an obstruction of the colon in infancy.
2. Diarrhea is not associated with pancreatitis.
3.Appendicitis is more common in younger patients than in older patients.
4. GIBD is manifested differently in a bimodal pattern.

9. A 70-year-old man is seeing a nurse practitioner because he is feeling weak and dizzy. The nurse practitioner is discussing a care plan with him and makes which of the following statements? Select all that apply.


1. I want to order a test for your heart to evaluate its function.
2. I will perform a thorough examination of your functional abilities.
3. I will order a blood sugar test to check for diabetes.
4. Many older people feel this way. It is to be expected.
5. I will assess you for the presence of other conditions. - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 5



Rationale:
1. A complete assessment will help differentiate signs of aging from disease.
2. All systems interact and can affect an existing condition.
3. Identifying underlying conditions will avoid undertreatment.
4. Attributing symptoms to aging can contribute to depression in an older person.
5. There are changes in the sympathetic response which contribute to the orthostasis and falls, as well as lack of hypoglycemic response.


10. The nurse practitioner is leading a class of seniors over age 65 years and is teaching about nutritional needs. One of the men asks why, even though he eats correctly according to the standards presented, he still feels weaker than he did 10 years ago. He also wonders why he gets more infections than he used to. Which of the following are helpful answers? Select all that apply.


1. I suggest that you exercise a little more than you are currently doing.
2. Some people experience a decrease in reserve energy.
3. For some people, the immune system weakens.
4. More viruses are being spread throughout the community.
5. I suggest that you see your primary caregiver for extensive testing. - 10. Answer: 2, 3, 5 , 3



Rationale:
1. Improved nutrition may not be the factor affecting health of elders.
2. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including lifestyle and medications.
3. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including changes in the immune system.
4. Viruses and other infections are not the only considerations for infections.
5. Biochemical individuality is important in detecting asymptomatic abnormalities in older adults. Significant homeostatic disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests, even though all individual test results may lie within normal limits of the reference interval for the entire group.


11. An older woman is seen in the ambulatory clinic for a routine checkup. The patient asks about results of her blood work compared to last year's results. How is it best for the clinician to respond? Select all that apply.


1. They are likely to be the same if you have had no diseases since then.
2. Blood work results may be different just because of your aging process.
3. Your results may be different because the body changes with disease and medications you are taking.
4. Blood work is not a reliable indicator of health because many things can affect your health that may not show up in the results of your blood work.
5. There is likely no significant difference as your body remains stable in its functioning. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 5



Rationale:
1.Biochemical individuality variation is often much smaller than variation within the larger group.
2. The aging process and decline in organ function may affect the health of elders.
3. Disease, nutrition, and medications affect the health of elders.
4. Although abnormal laboratory findings are often attributed to old age, rarely are they true aging changes.
5. Many factors can influence laboratory value interpretation in the elderly, including the physiological changes with aging, the prevalence of chronic disease, changes in nutritional and fluid intake, lifestyle (including activity), and the medications that are taken.


12. An elderly couple is discussing health concerns with the nurse practitioner. The couple is concerned that each of their individual blood studies show different results. One set of test results shows a significant decrease in blood sugar, but the test results of the partner does not show an equal
 
decrease. Their physician does not seem concerned, and the couple is wondering why. How is it best for the nurse practitioner to respond? Select all that apply.


1. Studies show that each person's pattern of chemical make-up is different.
2. There is no difference between one person's range of blood results and that of any other person.
3. Each person's chemical make-up is the same as that of others of the same gender and age group.
4. Many factors affect an individual's chemical make-up.
5. Ranges of the values provided by the laboratory are correct for any age. - 12. Answer: 1, 4, 3



Rationale:
1. Individuals experience smaller variations in laboratory work than from the others in the same age group.
2.There are wider variations of laboratory results within a group of older people.
3.Laboratory values are determined by more than age and gender.
4.Laboratory values may vary as a result of nutrition, activity, and emotional status.
5.The reference values presented for the older adult cohort are not necessarily correct for the individual due to biochemical individuality.


13. Adam, 70 years old, is admitted for possible myasthenia gravis (MG). The nurse practitioner knows that MG is commonly seen in women between 20 and 40 years old. Adam, however, is experiencing an ocular form of MG, has dysphonia, and does not have any thymus abnormalities. Adam asks why the nurse is concerned about MG since he is older and this is a &quot;young person's disease.&quot; Which of the following are the best answers? Select all that apply.


1. We need to assess for anything, just in case.
2. Some diseases show up in two different age and gender groups.
3. Older people often experience weakness, and we must rule out other conditions.
4. Your insurance will cover this, and we want to rule out as much as possible.
5. Signs and symptoms of illness are the same for each disease regardless of age. - 13. Answer: 2, 3




Rationale:
1.Ordering more tests than needed violates the principle of &quot;Do no harm.&quot;
2.MG is bimodal and can be found in younger women, as well as in both men and women.
 
3. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the nurse practitioner in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.
4. There should be a need for ordering a test and value attributed to the results.
5. The manifestations of illness and disease in the elderly can be very different, even if the underlying pathological process is the same as in younger individuals.


14. Mrs. Smith is 75 years old and has had type 2 diabetes for 30 years. She sees her nurse practitioner on a regular basis. Mrs. Smith asks the nurse practitioner why her treatment has not been changed, even though her laboratory values are seemingly out of normal range. Which of the following answers are best? Select all that apply.


1. A decision to make changes must be based on a pattern and not on one set of laboratory results.
2. The normal range charts are based on patients younger than 75 years.
3. Currently, it is too expensive to change your treatment.
4. Comparing new results with your prior results gives a more accurate picture.

3. Stretching routines are done slowly and to the level of endurance.
4. When the frail older person cannot ambulate, they can move other parts of their body such as core, arms, head, and neck. They may also do non-weight-bearing movements of legs and feet.
5. Movement, activity, and exercise can be done anywhere, anytime the individual desires. There is no need to join a group.


11. Nutrition counseling is part of health promotion. The nurse practitioner considers a teaching plan that includes which of the following information? Select all that apply.


1. Level of involvement in community activities.
2. Baseline information on current dietary intake.
3. Current activity patterns.
4. Current height and weight.
5. Health status information. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 4, 5



Rationale:
1. Active involvement in community activities does not reflect what the older person is eating.
2. The nurse practitioner needs the current state of nutrition to develop a plan for increasing or maintaining positive nutrition.
3. Knowing how much activity the person has affects the need for calories and nutrients.
4. Knowing the current height and weight aids in determining the body mass index, which is an indicator of normal weight or overweight.

4. Assuring the patient that while traveling there are limited opportunities for sexual encounters.
5. There is no need to assess an older patient's sexual preferences and practices. - 13. Answer: 1, 2, 3

Rationale:
1. Older adults are less likely to practice safe sex and use condoms.
2. Older people may be at increased danger from STIs because of the decreased perception of risk.
3. Current sexual history may determine the need for continued screening for STIs, HPV, and cervical cancer.
4. Encounters may be with fellow travelers, locals, or commercial sex workers.
5. Using the patient's sexual history, explore patient needs, preferences, and medical or psychological obstacles to sexual expression.


14. Mary, 72 years old, goes to the pharmacy to pick up her prescriptions. The pharmacist asks if she has had her immunizations. Mary replies, &quot;I had all my childhood shots, so I do not need any now.&quot; What should the nurse practitioner teach her about senior immunizations? Select all that apply.


1. Because the immune system may be weakened in older persons, immunizations are suggested.
2. Persons over the age of 50 years should have a yearly influenza vaccine.
3. The new Shingrix vaccine will help protect her from shingles.
4. The side effects of immunizations outweigh the benefits of immunizations.
5. The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a one-time dose. - 14. Answer: 1, 2, 3



Rationale:
1. The older person is susceptible to organisms that cause infection due to decreased immunity, nutrition, hydration, and other factors.
2. The influenza virus mutates each year and an updated version of the vaccine is needed to provide immunity. Influenza vaccine is now recommended annually for all adults over 50 years old, unless contraindicated.
3. Recently released Shingrix has been found to be more effective than the Zostavax, which was given previously.
4. Side effects are most often mild and localized. Viruses can cause serious or even lethal conditions.
5. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended as follows: Administer one-time dose to PCV13-naïve adults at age 65 years, followed by a dose of PPSV23 12 months later.


15. Mr. and Mrs. Jones are preparing to take a trip to Europe. The nurse practitioner includes the following teaching about taking care of their health while gone. Select all that apply.


1. Shorter airplane flights provide more chance to ambulate and relieve pressure on the back and legs.

3. Plan to fill your prescriptions when you are in a larger city.
4. Depending on the specific areas you will visit, certain immunizations may be needed.
5. You will most likely function as well when traveling as when at home. - 15. Answer: 1, 4
,



Rationale:
1. Long flights in cramped areas increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
2. Increased air pollution is a significant problem in many countries and affects pulmonary function.
3. The medications needed may not be available in some countries in Europe. Medicare does not cover medications filled outside of the United States.
4. Some areas of the world continue to see cases of yellow fever, malaria, and other diseases. When going to a vulnerable area, proper immunizations are required.
5. Some of the physiological and psychosocial changes that can occur with aging pose special risks during travel. How a patient functions at home may not be indicative of how well he or she will function in an unfamiliar environment.




1. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both 75 years old and are seeing their nurse practitioner for their annual checkups. Mrs. Smith wonders why they each have trouble digesting different foods.

1. Health of older people is affected by several factors.
2. A focused assessment will provide depth of specific information.
3. A comprehensive assessment will provide more subjective information.
4. A comprehensive assessment will result in a list of current and prior medications taken. - 2. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. A comprehensive approach to geriatric assessment is recommended because the physical health of the older adult is inextricably related to functional ability, psychosocial health, and a safe and enabling environment.
2. A focused assessment will provide a limited amount of information about the whole person.
3. A comprehensive assessment will provide both objective and subjective information.
4. A list of medications is only one component of a comprehensive assessment.

2. Acquire information about past medical conditions.
3. Determine which diagnostic tests are necessary.
4. Satisfy requirements of Medicare. - 5. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. The CGA is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary, and diagnostic process to identify needs and plan outcomes.
2. The CGA includes information from medical history, as well as the current assessment.
3. The CGA helps identify diagnostics, treatments, and other plan-of-care strategies.
4. The CGA is not a requirement of Medicare.


6. Mary Jane is seeing a nurse practitioner for a CGA and asks which parts of her life will be examined. The nurse practitioner says the domains of the CGA include:


1. Internal organ health.
2. Social habits.
3. Physical and psychological health, as well as other facets of life.
4. History of family illness. - 6. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. The CGA includes more than internal health.
2. Learning about social habits is not the only component in determining health.
3. Domains of CGA include physical health, psychological health, socio-environmental supports, mobility, functional status, and a measure of the quality of life.
4. Although family health history provides information about genetics, the CGA is complete and includes current health status in several domains.


7. In conducting a CGA, the nurse practitioner looks for any impairments in communication with the patient. The assessment includes:


1. Interviewing prior to the physical examination.
2. Asking questions of the accompanying family member.
3. Reading the history forms provided by the patient after the examination.
4. Observing physical impairments. - 7. Answer: 1


Rationale:
1. Interviewing begins before the physical examination and continues throughout the examination.
2. Permission from the patient must be obtained before discussing anything with the family member.
3. When forms about the history of the patient are brought in, the nurse practitioner should review them before the examination.
4. Observation alone will not provide adequate information about communication impairments.


8. When an assessment is conducted, which of the following needs to be recorded when a new concern is identified? Select all that apply.


1. Location and radiation.
2. Quantity and quality.
3. Aggravating and alleviating.

1. The Beers Criteria published in 1991
2. Medication Appropriateness Index
3. STOPP/START Criteria
4. HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications
5. Hospital formulary - 9. Answer: 2, 3



Rationale:
1. The Beers Criteria, 1991, was revised in 2015. Other criteria were also developed to address weaknesses found in the original Beers Criteria.
2. The Medications Appropriateness Test was developed to address some of the weak areas of the Beers
Criteria.
3. The STOPP/START Criteria were developed to determine when medications should be added and when another might be discontinued for an older patient.
4. The HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications does not guide in medication prescribing.
5. Hospital formulary provides a list of medications carried within that hospital.


10. While examining John, who is 80 years old, the nurse practitioner observes that as he rises from the chair he pauses and holds on to the rail. Asking John if this happens often, he replies, &quot;Yes, I get lightheaded and feel like I will fall.&quot; The nurse practitioner decides to conduct testing for orthostatic hypotension. This test includes which of the following? Select all that apply.


1. Having the patient lie down for 5 minutes, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.
2. Having the patient stand and wait a minute, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.
3. Having the patient jump in place for 2 minutes and then lie down.
4. Having the patient breathe deeply five times and then stand up.
5. Having the patient get up from his chair without using his arms, walk two to three steps, then back up to his chair and sit down. - 10. Answer: 1, 2


Rationale:
1.Obtaining baseline blood pressures is important to assess any changes.
2. Measuring the blood pressure after John gets up will show a drop if he experiences hypostatic hypotension.
3.Jumping in place is not a normal activity and is risky for older people.
4.Breathing deeply does not affect blood pressure significantly.
5.Mobility can be screened with the Timed Get Up and Go Test. This test involves observing for unsteadiness as the patient gets up from a chair without using the arms, walks 10 feet, turns around, walks back, and resumes a seated position.


11. In conducting a physical assessment of an older person, the nurse practioner assesses which of the following? Select all that apply.


1. Pulse oximetry
2. Weight
3. Color of hair
4. Functional assessment

3. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze.
4. Ability to gaze downward.
5. Absence of nystagmus. - 12. Answer: 2, 3,

 
Rationale:
1. An acuity of 20/20 is normal. Better than that is good.
2. Visual acuity of worse than 20/40 suggests weakness in the ability to see.
3. Abnormality in cardinal fields of gaze may indicate a neurological condition.
4. Ability to gaze downward is normal.
5. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze with nystagmus or lack of a downward gaze may reveal neurological disease.


13. Bertha is an 85-year-old grandmother who has multiple morbidities. Family members report that Bertha is not eating much and does not seem as active as usual.

1. Geriatric assessments can be challenging for the health-care provider due to delay of
recognition and/or reporting of symptoms by the patient. Which of the following best describes what is used by health-care providers to address this differential?


1. Clinical decision-making tools.
2. When symptoms were noticed.
3. Change in function and impact of symptoms.
4. Symptoms from comorbidities. - 1. Answer: 3
4



Rationale:
1. Using clinical decision-making tools can be complicated because of different factors, such as patient denial of symptoms and their occurrences.
2. Using the time symptoms were noticed as the basis for assessment cannot be deemed an effective tool due to inaccuracies regarding the report of when symptoms first occurred.
3. Change in function as a measure of the impact of a symptom on the patient is an effective means of sorting out the differential.
4. Comorbidities can result in a delayed or atypical presentation.


2. Which of the following terms refers to conditions that have multiple underlying factors and may involve multiple organs?


1. Multifaceted syndrome
2. Aging syndrome

Cough is often associated with conditions that are not life threatening.
2.
Cough is often isolated to the respiratory system.
3.
Cough may be a secondary symptom associated with the immune system.
4.
Cough is unlikely to be associated with acid reflux.


6. Tina is a 60-year-old female presenting symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum. She is being treated with antibiotics, use of a nebulizer, and oral steroids. Which of the following conditions could be her diagnosis?


1. Bacterial pneumonia
2. Acute bronchitis
3. Chronic bronchitis
4. GERD - 6. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.
Her symptoms are not typical of bacterial pneumonia, which is a common lung infection where the lungs' air sacks become inflamed. Signal symptoms may be fever as high as 105°F, along with profuse sweating, bluish lips and nails, and confusion.
2.
Antibiotics should not be used with acute bronchitis because it is viral.
3.
 
Chronic bronchitis is a condition that presents with symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum, and is often treated with antibiotics, use of a nebulizer, and oral steroids.
4.
GERD is a gastrointestinal condition that may be associated with coughing but is treated with an antihistamine and decongestant.


7. Reduction of pain is the main goal for patients suffering from acute joint pain. The mnemonic
PRICE is a helpful reminder of the treatment when this occurs. What does the &quot;E&quot; in PRICE stand for?


1. Elevation
2. Emergency
3. Elastic
4. Electrical - 7. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Elevating the joint above heart level may help reduce pain and swelling.
2. This is not part of the mnemonic.
3.This is not part of the mnemonic, although the &quot;P&quot; does stand for protection with a brace or wrap.
4. This is not part of the mnemonic.


8. A patient complains of dry, irritated, and itchy skin that has not been relieved with over-the-counter medications. On examination, the patient is also found to present cholestasis and jaundice. From which of the following conditions may the patient be suffering?


1. Lice
2. Scabies
3. Pruritus
4. Lichenification - 8. Answer:3 


Rationale:
1.
Lice may cause itching in the scalp but is generally localized.
2.
Scabies may cause itching of the skin but is generally localized.
3.
 
Pruritus is an unpleasant, irritating, or itching sensation on the surface of the skin that may lead to a desire to scratch. Inflammation results from activation of the immune response.
4.
Lichenification is the result of continued scratching and causes thickening of the skin.


9. Mr. Thomas noticed tremors in his right hand 2 years ago and attributed this to his elbow injury from a fall. The tremors have gradually worsened, and he now has tremors under his lip, some gait problems, and occasional stomach spasms. His wife has recently noticed these things
and suggested he have a medical consultation. Which of the following reasons might Mr. Thomas have had for ignoring these symptoms? Select all that apply.


1. Fear of loss of independence
2. Fear of doctors
3. Symptoms do not interfere with functions
4. Attributes symptoms to the aging process
5. Lack of transportation - 9. Answer: 1, 3,
4 4



Rationale:
1.
Fear of loss of independence may result in older adults not seeking medical help for illnesses.
2.
Fear of doctors is usually not a factor.
3.
If symptoms do not interfere with one's ability to function, sometimes medical help will not be sought.
4.
If an individual has a feeling that his symptoms are simply t">

1. Take herbal supplements.
2. Increase physical activity.
3. Take Aleve.
4. Get a massage. - 1. Answer: 2



Rationale:
1.Although there may be some herbal supplements that can help with arthritis, this is not the best suggestion because it does not promote increased physical activity.
2. Increased physical activity in older adults promotes wellness and quality of life.
3.Medication may be helpful for relief of symptoms but does not necessarily promote increased physical activity, which can help lead to better health.
4. Massage may provide temporary relief for arthritic joints, but physical activity is what can help lead to better health.


2. Many adults find reasons or barriers for not being able to exercise. Which of the following is an example of a patient barrier?


1. Good health, no functional limitations.
2. Insurance incentive.
3. High body mass index (BMI).
4. Frequent contact with prescriber. - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.Good health, no functional limitations is an example of a patient facilitator because it is not counterintuitive to pursuing good health.
2. Insurance incentive is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides incentive for the patient.
3. High BMI is an example of a patient barrier because it is something that may seem insurmountable to a patient.
4. Frequent contact with the prescriber is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides accountability in the pursuit of good health.


3. Mr. Osorio is a 65-year-old male who recently retired because of a medical condition. He has good family support and is very motivated to start a wellness program to prevent worsening of his condition. These factors are an example of:


1. Barriers
2. Incentives
3. Positive self-efficacy
4. Facilitators - 3. Answer: 4



Rationale:
1.Barriers are things that prevent or hinder patients from exercising.
2. Incentive is one kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
3.Positive self-efficacy is another kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
4.Facilitators are things that help a patient desire exercise and health promotion, so these are facilitators.


4. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has designed programs to incorporate exercise into every patient encounter. Which of the following is the correct phrase for this program?


1. Back to Exercise
2. Health and Wellness
3. Exercise is Medicine
4. Exercise is Wellness - 4. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. Back to Exercise is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
2. Health and Wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
3. Exercise is Medicine is the correct phrase for the program the ACSM has designed to incorporate discussion of exercise into patient encounters.
4. Exercise is wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.


4. Which of the following should nurse practitioners suggest to counter common patient excuses for not exercising?


1. Join a gym.
2. Find an exercise &quot;buddy.&quot;
3. Take a 10-minute walk every day.
4. Go to the YMCA. - 5. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1.Joining a gym is not the best suggestion to counter excuses not to exercise because having to go to the gym may become another excuse. There may also be financial and transportation issues adding to the reasons not to exercise.
2. Finding an exercise &quot;buddy&quot; may be helpful but still may impose the excuse of not being able to find one.
3. Taking a 10-minute walk every day is the best suggestion. With this suggestion a patient cannot make the excuse of not having time or equipment.
4. Going to the YMCA is not the best suggestion to counter excuses for the same reasons as joining a gym is not the best suggestion.


6. Older adults who have chronic conditions and are considering an increase in their physical activity should:


1. Start slowly, using lower weights with high repetitions.
2. Consult with a personal trainer.
3. Consult a health-care provider to help set physical activity goals that are realistic and safe.
4. Start with low repetitions but heavier weights. - 6. Answer:3 



Rationale:
1. Starting slowly with low weights and high repetitions may be a good start but must be monitored or initiated by an appropriate medical professional for instruction in proper use.
2. A consultation with a personal trainer is not the best option because some trainers may not be familiar with chronic conditions.
3. Consulting a health-care provider for physical activity goals that are realistic and safe is the best option.
4. Starting with low repetitions but heavier weights is not a good way to start an exercise program because it may result in injury.


7. Challenges to increasing physical activity are different for everyone. For instance, some patients may be experiencing depression or loss, some may have had significant life changes, and others may be dealing with functional limitations. As relates to increasing physical activity, these are examples of what?


1. Patient excuses
2. Patient facilitators
3. Patient ignorance regarding what to do
4. Patient barriers - 7. Answer: 4
 
Rationale:
1.Depression, interpersonal loss, significant life event changes, and functional limitations are not choices that one makes so are not excuses.
2.Patient facilitators are things that encourage a patient to do what is needed for good health.
3.These examples are not the result of what one doesn't know.
4.These are examples of patient barriers because they discourage a patient from a desire to promote health.


8. Which of the following is the focus of additional studies about the relationship between physical activities and cognitive changes?


1. Diet and supplements
2. Provider and patients
3. Social support and patients
4. Medical conditions and medications - 8. Answer: 1




Rationale:
1. Diet and supplements are the focus of these additional studies.
2. Although provider and patient relationship is important, these are not the focus of these additional studies.
3. Although a patient's social support is important, it is not the focus of these additional studies.
4. Medical conditions and medications should be considered in physical activity, but it is not the focus of these additional studies.


9. With the recognition that baby boomers will increase the over 65 population exponentially, guidelines for increasing physical activity in older adults have been issued. Which of the following programs is dedicated to health promotion in older adults? Select all that apply.


1. The Healthy People 2020 initiative

10. Mr. Fekjar is diagnosed with unstable angina. Which of the following is a contraindication for exercise therapy and prevents patients from joining an exercise program?
Select all that apply.


1. Uncontrolled hypertension
2. Fibromyalgia
3. Unstable aortic aneurysm
4. Chondromalacia
5. Hypoxemia - 10. Answer: 1, 3




Rationale:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension is a medical contraindication for exercise therapy.
2. Fibromyalgia is a condition in which exercise therapy is useful for health promotion.
3. Unstable aortic aneurysm is a medical contraindication for exercise therapy.
4. Chondromalacia is an orthopedic condition in which exercise therapy is useful for health promotion.
5. Low oxygen saturation or hypoxemia is a below-normal level of oxygen in the blood, specifically in the arteries. Hypoxemia is a sign of a problem related to breathing or circulation, and may result in various symptoms, such as shortness of breath and dizziness during exercise. Though it is not a contraindication for exercise therapy, its symptoms could be a barrier.


11. Which of the following may be included in the healthy lifestyle counseling during the initial
Welcome to Medicare visit? Select all that apply.


1. Level of physical activity assessment.
2. Physical therapy consultation.
3. Referral to an herbalist.
4. Referral to a health coach.
5. Referral to an acupuncturist. - 11. Answer: 1, 2, 4




Rationale:
1 Current level of physical activity is assessed during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.
2. Physical therapy consultation may be recommended for patients with disabilities or functional limitations.
3. Referral to an herbalist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.
4. Referral to a health coach may be recommended to patients during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit to keep them engaged.
5. Referral to an acupuncturist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.


12. Incorporating exercise into patients' lifestyles can be effectively achieved by including which of the following in your discussions with patients? Select all that apply.


1. Talking about the importance of exercise.
2. Encouraging goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient.
3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home.
4. Informing the patient about resources that are available in the community for group exercise.
5. Giving an illustration of the exercises. - 12. Answer: 2, 4




Rationale:
1.Handing a program or exercise prescription to the patient is more effective than just talking about it.
2.Goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient is very effective in persuading the patient to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home may not be the best approach for different reasons, such as financial ability.
4. Informing patients about the resources that are available in the community for group exercise is a valuable adjunct to counseling.
5. Though not listed as something that could promote exercise, giving the patient illustrations for the exercise could be helpful when it is demonstrated and explained.


13. The goal of increasing physical activity is to promote a healthy lifestyle. Which of the following options help reduce the risk of injuries? Select all that apply.


1. Choosing physical activities that are appropriate for their current fitness level and health goals.
2. Remaining under the care of a health-care provider if they have chronic conditions or symptoms.
3. Choosing to do physical activities their friends are doing.
4. Enlisting spousal supervision and support.
5. Hiring a personal trainer. - 13. Answer: 1, 2




Rationale:
1.Choosing to do types of physical activities that are appropriate for a patient's current fitness level and health goals helps reduce the risk of injuries.
2. Being under the care of a health-care provider if a patient has chronic conditions or symptoms helps reduce the risk of injuries.
3. Choosing to do types of physical activities one's friends are doing is not the best option in reducing risk for injuries because of differences in physical ability or medical conditions.
4. Being under the supervision of one's spouse for support is a good facilitator, but it is not the best option in reducing the risk for injures because a spouse may not understand the impact of physical activity on physical and medical conditions.
5. A personal trainer may not have the proper training for more complicated conditions.


14. The AHA Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism identified patient facilitators to increasing physical activity in older adults. Which of the following is an example of patient facilitators? Select all that apply.
1. Frequent contact with prescriber.
2. Planned program.
3. Making time.
4. Purchasing new equipment.
5. Ignorance of exercise. - 14. Answer: 1,2 



Rationale:
1.Frequent contact with a prescriber has been seen to be a patient facilitator.
2. A planned program has resulted in facilitation toward health motivation.
3. Making time is a patient choice rather than a facilitator toward making changes.
4. Purchasing new equipment is not an example of a patient facilitator and may not be doable for all patients.
5.Ignorance of what to do is not a patient facilitator but a barrier to increasing physical activities.


15. To perform physical activity safely and reduce the risk of injuries and other adverse events, which of the following are advisable? Select all that apply.


1. Start fast to get acclimated to the activities.
2. Use their instincts.
3. Use appropriate protective gear.
4. Follow rules and policies.
5. Have an exercise &quot;buddy.&quot; - 15. Answer: 3, 4




Rationale:
1.Starting fast could actually increase the possibility of injury.
2.There is no guarantee that instincts are correct.
3.Using appropriate protective gear is recommended to reduce the risk of injuries.
4.Rules and policies are made to inform and protect, therefore, following them will help to reduce the risk of injuries.
5.Having an exercise &quot;buddy&quot; may make the activity fun but will not necessarily reduce risk of injuries, especially if the buddy does not understand the concepts of exercises and physical activity physiology.


1. Mrs. Smith, 75 years old, reports that she is weak, has difficulty urinating, and is dehydrated. Although she is afebrile, the nurse conducts a thorough physical examination, including urinalysis and complete blood count (CBC). The total assessment is necessary because:
1. All body systems interact, and symptoms could indicate a variety of diagnoses.
2. The symptoms are vague and may be signs of aging.
3. There may be other signs or symptoms more indicative of the condition.
4. Mrs. Smith may not be reporting all significant information. - 1. Answer: 1


Rationale:
1.The clinician must be aware that all the systems interact and, in doing so, can increase the older person's vulnerability to illness/disease.
2.The nurse must not attribute symptoms only to the aging process.
3. There may be comorbidities accompanying this condition.
4. Assumptions of not reporting properly may not be true.


2. A patient with renal disease has blood work drawn, and the results show an increase in serum creatinine. The nurse practitioner needs to know which of the following laboratory values before ordering medications?


1. CBC
2. Culture and sensitivity of the urine
3. Creatinine clearance
4. Uric acid levels - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.A CBC will not evaluate kidney function for a patient with renal disease.
2.A culture and sensitivity test reflects the presence of an infection and the antibiotic to which the organism is sensitive.
3. The calculation of creatinine clearance provides an estimation of renal function.
4. Uric acid level is elevated in the presence of gout.


3. Which of the following statements is true regarding diagnostic testing?


1. A test is ordered for a specific purpose.
2. A test is the most invasive available.
3. There is no need to discuss results with the patient.
4. If a test is needed, it should be ordered regardless of risk to the patient. - 3. Answer:1 



Rationale:
1. The nurse practitioner should have a plan for the use of each test result value obtained.
2. When considering which laboratory tests to order, it is worth remembering the doctrine primum no nnocere—first, do no harm.
3. Once laboratory tests are available for review, tests results should be discussed with the patient, with abnormal test results interpreted for the aging individual and addressed with the patient and caregivers.
4. Any risks involved in laboratory testing must be considered concerning the patient's clinical condition and weighed against the test's expected benefits.


4. Janey, 25 years old, may experience arthritis differently than 65-year-old Mrs. Johnson because:


1. The body undergoes physiological changes with aging.
2. A healthy body does not experience significant changes as one gets older.
3. Older patients do not feel any systemic symptoms, such as malaise and weight loss.
4. Even though the same joints are usually affected, age makes it feel different. - 4. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the advanced practice nurse in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.
2. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may be different depending on the age of the patient.
3. Younger patients may not experience constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.
4. In late-onset rheumatoid arthritis, the joint involvement is more often in the larger joints.


5. The nurse practitioner is examining an 85-year-old man with reports of abdominal pain, weakness, and loss of appetite. Which is the most likely condition to be tested for and ruled out?


1. Neoplasms and carcinomas
2. Partial seizure
3. Sarcopenia
4. Hirschsprung's disease - 5. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. Certain diseases, such as neoplasms and carcinomas, are more common in the elderly, and an understanding of the epidemiology is critical in the interpretation.
2.Partial seizure is more common in early old age.
3. Sarcopenia is more common in early old age.
4. Hirschsprung's disease is most common in infancy.


6. For individuals over 65 years old, the most common morbidities are related to:


1. Heart disease, arthritis
2. Respiratory problems, cancer
3. Diabetes, stroke
4. All of these are common morbidities. - 6. Answer: 4




Rationale:
1.Heart disease is one of the common morbidities.
2.Cancer is common in the general population; however, specific types are more common in the older patient.
3. Diabetes is common in patients over 40 years of age.
4. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined are the most common morbidities in older patients.


7. A gerontological patient is being examined for a report of pain in the shoulder. The nurse practitioner completes a thorough systemic examination because:


1. Older patients with one morbidity often express difficulties in general.
2. Arthritis of the shoulder is accompanied by other neurological symptoms.
3. Older patients with arthritis often experience pain in lower extremities.
4. The patient may not report significant signs and symptoms. - 7. Answer:1 



Rationale:
1. Older patients with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis experience joint involvement more often in the larger joints, such as the shoulder, and they also experience systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.
2. Older patients may express symptoms in any other physical systems.
3. Patients more often experience arthritis in smaller joints.
4. A thorough examination will detect objective indicators.


8. The nurse practitioner performs a thorough systemic examination of a patient who reports diarrhea and pain in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. One possible diagnosis would be:


1. Hirschsprung's disease
2. Pancreatitis
3. Appendicitis
4. Gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease (GIBD) - 8. Answer:4 



Rationale:
1. Hirschsprung's disease is an obstruction of the colon in infancy.
2. Diarrhea is not associated with pancreatitis.
3.Appendicitis is more common in younger patients than in older patients.
4. GIBD is manifested differently in a bimodal pattern.

9. A 70-year-old man is seeing a nurse practitioner because he is feeling weak and dizzy. The nurse practitioner is discussing a care plan with him and makes which of the following statements? Select all that apply.


1. I want to order a test for your heart to evaluate its function.
2. I will perform a thorough examination of your functional abilities.
3. I will order a blood sugar test to check for diabetes.
4. Many older people feel this way. It is to be expected.
5. I will assess you for the presence of other conditions. - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 5



Rationale:
1. A complete assessment will help differentiate signs of aging from disease.
2. All systems interact and can affect an existing condition.
3. Identifying underlying conditions will avoid undertreatment.
4. Attributing symptoms to aging can contribute to depression in an older person.
5. There are changes in the sympathetic response which contribute to the orthostasis and falls, as well as lack of hypoglycemic response.


10. The nurse practitioner is leading a class of seniors over age 65 years and is teaching about nutritional needs. One of the men asks why, even though he eats correctly according to the standards presented, he still feels weaker than he did 10 years ago. He also wonders why he gets more infections than he used to. Which of the following are helpful answers? Select all that apply.


1. I suggest that you exercise a little more than you are currently doing.
2. Some people experience a decrease in reserve energy.
3. For some people, the immune system weakens.
4. More viruses are being spread throughout the community.
5. I suggest that you see your primary caregiver for extensive testing. - 10. Answer: 2, 3, 5 , 3



Rationale:
1. Improved nutrition may not be the factor affecting health of elders.
2. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including lifestyle and medications.
3. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including changes in the immune system.
4. Viruses and other infections are not the only considerations for infections.
5. Biochemical individuality is important in detecting asymptomatic abnormalities in older adults. Significant homeostatic disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests, even though all individual test results may lie within normal limits of the reference interval for the entire group.


11. An older woman is seen in the ambulatory clinic for a routine checkup. The patient asks about results of her blood work compared to last year's results. How is it best for the clinician to respond? Select all that apply.


1. They are likely to be the same if you have had no diseases since then.
2. Blood work results may be different just because of your aging process.
3. Your results may be different because the body changes with disease and medications you are taking.
4. Blood work is not a reliable indicator of health because many things can affect your health that may not show up in the results of your blood work.
5. There is likely no significant difference as your body remains stable in its functioning. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 5



Rationale:
1.Biochemical individuality variation is often much smaller than variation within the larger group.
2. The aging process and decline in organ function may affect the health of elders.
3. Disease, nutrition, and medications affect the health of elders.
4. Although abnormal laboratory findings are often attributed to old age, rarely are they true aging changes.
5. Many factors can influence laboratory value interpretation in the elderly, including the physiological changes with aging, the prevalence of chronic disease, changes in nutritional and fluid intake, lifestyle (including activity), and the medications that are taken.


12. An elderly couple is discussing health concerns with the nurse practitioner. The couple is concerned that each of their individual blood studies show different results. One set of test results shows a significant decrease in blood sugar, but the test results of the partner does not show an equal
 
decrease. Their physician does not seem concerned, and the couple is wondering why. How is it best for the nurse practitioner to respond? Select all that apply.


1. Studies show that each person's pattern of chemical make-up is different.
2. There is no difference between one person's range of blood results and that of any other person.
3. Each person's chemical make-up is the same as that of others of the same gender and age group.
4. Many factors affect an individual's chemical make-up.
5. Ranges of the values provided by the laboratory are correct for any age. - 12. Answer: 1, 4, 3



Rationale:
1. Individuals experience smaller variations in laboratory work than from the others in the same age group.
2.There are wider variations of laboratory results within a group of older people.
3.Laboratory values are determined by more than age and gender.
4.Laboratory values may vary as a result of nutrition, activity, and emotional status.
5.The reference values presented for the older adult cohort are not necessarily correct for the individual due to biochemical individuality.


13. Adam, 70 years old, is admitted for possible myasthenia gravis (MG). The nurse practitioner knows that MG is commonly seen in women between 20 and 40 years old. Adam, however, is experiencing an ocular form of MG, has dysphonia, and does not have any thymus abnormalities. Adam asks why the nurse is concerned about MG since he is older and this is a &quot;young person's disease.&quot; Which of the following are the best answers? Select all that apply.


1. We need to assess for anything, just in case.
2. Some diseases show up in two different age and gender groups.
3. Older people often experience weakness, and we must rule out other conditions.
4. Your insurance will cover this, and we want to rule out as much as possible.
5. Signs and symptoms of illness are the same for each disease regardless of age. - 13. Answer: 2, 3




Rationale:
1.Ordering more tests than needed violates the principle of &quot;Do no harm.&quot;
2.MG is bimodal and can be found in younger women, as well as in both men and women.
 
3. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the nurse practitioner in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.
4. There should be a need for ordering a test and value attributed to the results.
5. The manifestations of illness and disease in the elderly can be very different, even if the underlying pathological process is the same as in younger individuals.


14. Mrs. Smith is 75 years old and has had type 2 diabetes for 30 years. She sees her nurse practitioner on a regular basis. Mrs. Smith asks the nurse practitioner why her treatment has not been changed, even though her laboratory values are seemingly out of normal range. Which of the following answers are best? Select all that apply.


1. A decision to make changes must be based on a pattern and not on one set of laboratory results.
2. The normal range charts are based on patients younger than 75 years.
3. Currently, it is too expensive to change your treatment.
4. Comparing new results with your prior results gives a more accurate picture.
5. Normal values for laboratory tests differ as one gets older. - 14. Answer: 1, 4, 5




Rationale:
1.Blood studies are more valuable when assessing for an increase or decrease in values.
2. It is not helpful to use aging as an explanation for possible abnormal results.
3. If a change in treatment is appropriate, the least expensive alternative should be sought.
4. Significant disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests.
5. The clinician must determine whether a value obtained reflects a normal aging change, a disease, or the potential for disease.


15. Mr. Adams is 90 years old. In the last few months he appears unable to comply with the health- care plan developed by the nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner considers which of the following reasons for noncompliance when updating his home care plan? Select all that apply.

3. Stretching routines are done slowly and to the level of endurance.
4. When the frail older person cannot ambulate, they can move other parts of their body such as core, arms, head, and neck. They may also do non-weight-bearing movements of legs and feet.
5. Movement, activity, and exercise can be done anywhere, anytime the individual desires. There is no need to join a group.


11. Nutrition counseling is part of health promotion. The nurse practitioner considers a teaching plan that includes which of the following information? Select all that apply.


1. Level of involvement in community activities.
2. Baseline information on current dietary intake.
3. Current activity patterns.
4. Current height and weight.
5. Health status information. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 4, 5



Rationale:
1. Active involvement in community activities does not reflect what the older person is eating.
2. The nurse practitioner needs the current state of nutrition to develop a plan for increasing or maintaining positive nutrition.
3. Knowing how much activity the person has affects the need for calories and nutrients.
4. Knowing the current height and weight aids in determining the body mass index, which is an indicator of normal weight or overweight.

4. Assuring the patient that while traveling there are limited opportunities for sexual encounters.
5. There is no need to assess an older patient's sexual preferences and practices. - 13. Answer: 1, 2, 3

Rationale:
1. Older adults are less likely to practice safe sex and use condoms.
2. Older people may be at increased danger from STIs because of the decreased perception of risk.
3. Current sexual history may determine the need for continued screening for STIs, HPV, and cervical cancer.
4. Encounters may be with fellow travelers, locals, or commercial sex workers.
5. Using the patient's sexual history, explore patient needs, preferences, and medical or psychological obstacles to sexual expression.


14. Mary, 72 years old, goes to the pharmacy to pick up her prescriptions. The pharmacist asks if she has had her immunizations. Mary replies, &quot;I had all my childhood shots, so I do not need any now.&quot; What should the nurse practitioner teach her about senior immunizations? Select all that apply.


1. Because the immune system may be weakened in older persons, immunizations are suggested.
2. Persons over the age of 50 years should have a yearly influenza vaccine.
3. The new Shingrix vaccine will help protect her from shingles.
4. The side effects of immunizations outweigh the benefits of immunizations.
5. The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a one-time dose. - 14. Answer: 1, 2, 3



Rationale:
1. The older person is susceptible to organisms that cause infection due to decreased immunity, nutrition, hydration, and other factors.
2. The influenza virus mutates each year and an updated version of the vaccine is needed to provide immunity. Influenza vaccine is now recommended annually for all adults over 50 years old, unless contraindicated.
3. Recently released Shingrix has been found to be more effective than the Zostavax, which was given previously.
4. Side effects are most often mild and localized. Viruses can cause serious or even lethal conditions.
5. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended as follows: Administer one-time dose to PCV13-naïve adults at age 65 years, followed by a dose of PPSV23 12 months later.


15. Mr. and Mrs. Jones are preparing to take a trip to Europe. The nurse practitioner includes the following teaching about taking care of their health while gone. Select all that apply.


1. Shorter airplane flights provide more chance to ambulate and relieve pressure on the back and legs.
2. Generally speaking, the air in Europe is cleaner than the air in the United States, so you should have no problems with your respiratory conditions.
3. Plan to fill your prescriptions when you are in a larger city.
4. Depending on the specific areas you will visit, certain immunizations may be needed.
5. You will most likely function as well when traveling as when at home. - 15. Answer: 1, 4
,



Rationale:
1. Long flights in cramped areas increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
2. Increased air pollution is a significant problem in many countries and affects pulmonary function.
3. The medications needed may not be available in some countries in Europe. Medicare does not cover medications filled outside of the United States.
4. Some areas of the world continue to see cases of yellow fever, malaria, and other diseases. When going to a vulnerable area, proper immunizations are required.
5. Some of the physiological and psychosocial changes that can occur with aging pose special risks during travel. How a patient functions at home may not be indicative of how well he or she will function in an unfamiliar environment.




1. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both 75 years old and are seeing their nurse practitioner for their annual checkups. Mrs. Smith wonders why they each have trouble digesting different foods.

2. The nurse practitioner conducts a comprehensive geriatric assessment of the older individual because:


1. Health of older people is affected by several factors.
2. A focused assessment will provide depth of specific information.
3. A comprehensive assessment will provide more subjective information.
4. A comprehensive assessment will result in a list of current and prior medications taken. - 2. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. A comprehensive approach to geriatric assessment is recommended because the physical health of the older adult is inextricably related to functional ability, psychosocial health, and a safe and enabling environment.
2. A focused assessment will provide a limited amount of information about the whole person.
3. A comprehensive assessment will provide both objective and subjective information.
4. A list of medications is only one component of a comprehensive assessment.


3. The nurse practitioner knows that conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is more beneficial for which of the following groups?


1. People between 60 and 70 years old.
2. People over 70 years old.

4. People over 55 years old. - 3. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.People between 60 and 70 years old are likely to be healthy.
2. People over 70 years old have a variety of levels of health.
3. Vulnerable older adults and frail older adults will benefit most from a CGA because of lower physiological reserves and higher risk of iatrogenic complications.
4. People over 55 years old may not be considered the appropriate age for a CGA.


4. A family member comes into the clinician's office with her older mother, the patient. In the process of the examination, the nurse practitioner identifies the patient as &quot;frail older adult.&quot; The family member asks what that means. The nurse practitioner explains that this refers to:

2. Acquire information about past medical conditions.
3. Determine which diagnostic tests are necessary.
4. Satisfy requirements of Medicare. - 5. Answer: 1



Rationale:
1. The CGA is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary, and diagnostic process to identify needs and plan outcomes.
2. The CGA includes information from medical history, as well as the current assessment.
3. The CGA helps identify diagnostics, treatments, and other plan-of-care strategies.
4. The CGA is not a requirement of Medicare.


6. Mary Jane is seeing a nurse practitioner for a CGA and asks which parts of her life will be examined. The nurse practitioner says the domains of the CGA include:


1. Internal organ health.
2. Social habits.
3. Physical and psychological health, as well as other facets of life.
4. History of family illness. - 6. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. The CGA includes more than internal health.
2. Learning about social habits is not the only component in determining health.
3. Domains of CGA include physical health, psychological health, socio-environmental supports, mobility, functional status, and a measure of the quality of life.
4. Although family health history provides information about genetics, the CGA is complete and includes current health status in several domains.


7. In conducting a CGA, the nurse practitioner looks for any impairments in communication with the patient. The assessment includes:


1. Interviewing prior to the physical examination.
2. Asking questions of the accompanying family member.
3. Reading the history forms provided by the patient after the examination.
4. Observing physical impairments. - 7. Answer: 1


Rationale:
1. Interviewing begins before the physical examination and continues throughout the examination.
2. Permission from the patient must be obtained before discussing anything with the family member.
3. When forms about the history of the patient are brought in, the nurse practitioner should review them before the examination.
4. Observation alone will not provide adequate information about communication impairments.


8. When an assessment is conducted, which of the following needs to be recorded when a new concern is identified? Select all that apply.


1. Location and radiation.
2. Quantity and quality.
3. Aggravating and alleviating.

1. The Beers Criteria published in 1991
2. Medication Appropriateness Index
3. STOPP/START Criteria
4. HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications
5. Hospital formulary - 9. Answer: 2, 3



Rationale:
1. The Beers Criteria, 1991, was revised in 2015. Other criteria were also developed to address weaknesses found in the original Beers Criteria.
2. The Medications Appropriateness Test was developed to address some of the weak areas of the Beers
Criteria.
3. The STOPP/START Criteria were developed to determine when medications should be added and when another might be discontinued for an older patient.
4. The HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications does not guide in medication prescribing.
5. Hospital formulary provides a list of medications carried within that hospital.


10. While examining John, who is 80 years old, the nurse practitioner observes that as he rises from the chair he pauses and holds on to the rail. Asking John if this happens often, he replies, &quot;Yes, I get lightheaded and feel like I will fall.&quot; The nurse practitioner decides to conduct testing for orthostatic hypotension. This test includes which of the following? Select all that apply.


1. Having the patient lie down for 5 minutes, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.
2. Having the patient stand and wait a minute, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.
3. Having the patient jump in place for 2 minutes and then lie down.
4. Having the patient breathe deeply five times and then stand up.
5. Having the patient get up from his chair without using his arms, walk two to three steps, then back up to his chair and sit down. - 10. Answer: 1, 2


Rationale:
1.Obtaining baseline blood pressures is important to assess any changes.
2. Measuring the blood pressure after John gets up will show a drop if he experiences hypostatic hypotension.
3.Jumping in place is not a normal activity and is risky for older people.
4.Breathing deeply does not affect blood pressure significantly.
5.Mobility can be screened with the Timed Get Up and Go Test. This test involves observing for unsteadiness as the patient gets up from a chair without using the arms, walks 10 feet, turns around, walks back, and resumes a seated position.


11. In conducting a physical assessment of an older person, the nurse practioner assesses which of the following? Select all that apply.


1. Pulse oximetry
2. Weight
3. Color of hair
4. Functional assessment
5. Presence of pain - 11. Answer: 1, 2, 4, 5

2. Visual acuity worse than 20/40.
3. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze.
4. Ability to gaze downward.
5. Absence of nystagmus. - 12. Answer: 2, 3,

 
Rationale:
1. An acuity of 20/20 is normal. Better than that is good.
2. Visual acuity of worse than 20/40 suggests weakness in the ability to see.
3. Abnormality in cardinal fields of gaze may indicate a neurological condition.
4. Ability to gaze downward is normal.
5. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze with nystagmus or lack of a downward gaze may reveal neurological disease.


13. Bertha is an 85-year-old grandmother who has multiple morbidities. Family members report that Bertha is not eating much and does not seem as active as usual.

1. Geriatric assessments can be challenging for the health-care provider due to delay of
recognition and/or reporting of symptoms by the patient. Which of the following best describes what is used by health-care providers to address this differential?


1. Clinical decision-making tools.
2. When symptoms were noticed.
3. Change in function and impact of symptoms.
4. Symptoms from comorbidities. - 1. Answer: 3
4



Rationale:
1. Using clinical decision-making tools can be complicated because of different factors, such as patient denial of symptoms and their occurrences.
2. Using the time symptoms were noticed as the basis for assessment cannot be deemed an effective tool due to inaccuracies regarding the report of when symptoms first occurred.
3. Change in function as a measure of the impact of a symptom on the patient is an effective means of sorting out the differential.
4. Comorbidities can result in a delayed or atypical presentation.


2. Which of the following terms refers to conditions that have multiple underlying factors and may involve multiple organs?


1. Multifaceted syndrome
2. Aging syndrome

1. Mrs. Keating is a 70-year-old woman suffering from arthritis. She is seeing the nurse practitioner for her regular che...</p>
                                <span class="show-more " data-extra-text="ckup. For a person with chronic degenerative conditions, which of the following should the nurse suggest for health promotion?


1. Take herbal supplements.
2. Increase physical activity.
3. Take Aleve.
4. Get a massage. - 1. Answer: 2



Rationale:
1.Although there may be some herbal supplements that can help with arthritis, this is not the best suggestion because it does not promote increased physical activity.
2. Increased physical activity in older adults promotes wellness and quality of life.
3.Medication may be helpful for relief of symptoms but does not necessarily promote increased physical activity, which can help lead to better health.
4. Massage may provide temporary relief for arthritic joints, but physical activity is what can help lead to better health.


2. Many adults find reasons or barriers for not being able to exercise. Which of the following is an example of a patient barrier?


1. Good health, no functional limitations.
2. Insurance incentive.
3. High body mass index (BMI).
4. Frequent contact with prescriber. - 2. Answer: 3



Rationale:
1.Good health, no functional limitations is an example of a patient facilitator because it is not counterintuitive to pursuing good health.
2. Insurance incentive is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides incentive for the patient.
3. High BMI is an example of a patient barrier because it is something that may seem insurmountable to a patient.
4. Frequent contact with the prescriber is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides accountability in the pursuit of good health.


3. Mr. Osorio is a 65-year-old male who recently retired because of a medical condition. He has good family support and is very motivated to start a wellness program to prevent worsening of his condition. These factors are an example of:


1. Barriers
2. Incentives
3. Positive self-efficacy
4. Facilitators - 3. Answer: 4



Rationale:
1.Barriers are things that prevent or hinder patients from exercising.
2. Incentive is one kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
3.Positive self-efficacy is another kind of patient facilitator, like family support.
4.Facilitators are things that help a patient desire exercise and health promotion, so these are facilitators.


4. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has designed programs to incorporate exercise into every patient encounter. Which of the following is the correct phrase for this program?


1. Back to Exercise
2. Health and Wellness
3. Exercise is Medicine
4. Exercise is Wellness - 4. Answer: 3




Rationale:
1. Back to Exercise is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
2. Health and Wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.
3. Exercise is Medicine is the correct phrase for the program the ACSM has designed to incorporate discussion of exercise into patient encounters.
4. Exercise is wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.


4. Which of the following should nurse practitioners suggest to counter common patient excuses for not exercising?

Mrs. Keating is a 70-year-old woman suffering from arthritis. She is seeing the nurse practitioner for her regular checkup. For a person with chronic degenerative conditions, which of the following should the nurse suggest for health promotion?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Take herbal supplements.\r\n2. Increase physical activity.\r\n3. Take Aleve.\r\n4. Get a massage. - 1. Answer: 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Although there may be some herbal supplements that can help with arthritis, this is not the best suggestion because it does not promote increased physical activity.\r\n2. Increased physical activity in older adults promotes wellness and quality of life.\r\n3.Medication may be helpful for relief of symptoms but does not necessarily promote increased physical activity, which can help lead to better health.\r\n4. Massage may provide temporary relief for arthritic joints, but physical activity is what can help lead to better health.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Many adults find reasons or barriers for not being able to exercise. Which of the following is an example of a patient barrier?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Good health, no functional limitations.\r\n2. Insurance incentive.\r\n3. High body mass index (BMI).\r\n4. Frequent contact with prescriber. - 2. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Good health, no functional limitations is an example of a patient facilitator because it is not counterintuitive to pursuing good health.\r\n2. Insurance incentive is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides incentive for the patient.\r\n3. High BMI is an example of a patient barrier because it is something that may seem insurmountable to a patient.\r\n4. Frequent contact with the prescriber is an example of a patient facilitator because it provides accountability in the pursuit of good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Mr. Osorio is a 65-year-old male who recently retired because of a medical condition. He has good family support and is very motivated to start a wellness program to prevent worsening of his condition. These factors are an example of:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Barriers\r\n2. Incentives\r\n3. Positive self-efficacy\r\n4. Facilitators - 3. Answer: 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Barriers are things that prevent or hinder patients from exercising.\r\n2. Incentive is one kind of patient facilitator, like family support.\r\n3.Positive self-efficacy is another kind of patient facilitator, like family support.\r\n4.Facilitators are things that help a patient desire exercise and health promotion, so these are facilitators.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has designed programs to incorporate exercise into every patient encounter. Which of the following is the correct phrase for this program?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Back to Exercise\r\n2. Health and Wellness\r\n3. Exercise is Medicine\r\n4. Exercise is Wellness - 4. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Back to Exercise is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.\r\n2. Health and Wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.\r\n3. Exercise is Medicine is the correct phrase for the program the ACSM has designed to incorporate discussion of exercise into patient encounters.\r\n4. Exercise is wellness is not the correct phrase for the program the ACSM designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Which of the following should nurse practitioners suggest to counter common patient excuses for not exercising?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Join a gym.\r\n2. Find an exercise \"buddy.\"\r\n3. Take a 10-minute walk every day.\r\n4. Go to the YMCA. - 5. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Joining a gym is not the best suggestion to counter excuses not to exercise because having to go to the gym may become another excuse. There may also be financial and transportation issues adding to the reasons not to exercise.\r\n2. Finding an exercise \"buddy\" may be helpful but still may impose the excuse of not being able to find one.\r\n3. Taking a 10-minute walk every day is the best suggestion. With this suggestion a patient cannot make the excuse of not having time or equipment.\r\n4. Going to the YMCA is not the best suggestion to counter excuses for the same reasons as joining a gym is not the best suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Older adults who have chronic conditions and are considering an increase in their physical activity should:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Start slowly, using lower weights with high repetitions.\r\n2. Consult with a personal trainer.\r\n3. Consult a health-care provider to help set physical activity goals that are realistic and safe.\r\n4. Start with low repetitions but heavier weights. - 6. Answer:3 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Starting slowly with low weights and high repetitions may be a good start but must be monitored or initiated by an appropriate medical professional for instruction in proper use.\r\n2. A consultation with a personal trainer is not the best option because some trainers may not be familiar with chronic conditions.\r\n3. Consulting a health-care provider for physical activity goals that are realistic and safe is the best option.\r\n4. Starting with low repetitions but heavier weights is not a good way to start an exercise program because it may result in injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Challenges to increasing physical activity are different for everyone. For instance, some patients may be experiencing depression or loss, some may have had significant life changes, and others may be dealing with functional limitations. As relates to increasing physical activity, these are examples of what?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Patient excuses\r\n2. Patient facilitators\r\n3. Patient ignorance regarding what to do\r\n4. Patient barriers - 7. Answer: 4\r\n \r\nRationale:\r\n1.Depression, interpersonal loss, significant life event changes, and functional limitations are not choices that one makes so are not excuses.\r\n2.Patient facilitators are things that encourage a patient to do what is needed for good health.\r\n3.These examples are not the result of what one doesn't know.\r\n4.These are examples of patient barriers because they discourage a patient from a desire to promote health.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Which of the following is the focus of additional studies about the relationship between physical activities and cognitive changes?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Diet and supplements\r\n2. Provider and patients\r\n3. Social support and patients\r\n4. Medical conditions and medications - 8. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Diet and supplements are the focus of these additional studies.\r\n2. Although provider and patient relationship is important, these are not the focus of these additional studies.\r\n3. Although a patient's social support is important, it is not the focus of these additional studies.\r\n4. Medical conditions and medications should be considered in physical activity, but it is not the focus of these additional studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. With the recognition that baby boomers will increase the over 65 population exponentially, guidelines for increasing physical activity in older adults have been issued. Which of the following programs is dedicated to health promotion in older adults? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Healthy People 2020 initiative\r\n2. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid\r\n3. The American Medical Association\r\n4. The National Institute on Aging\r\n5. The American Heart Association (AHA) - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n 1. The Healthy People 2020 initiative has several sections dedicated to health promotion for older adults.\r\n2.The Center for Medicare and Medicaid has programs to promote wellness and quality of life in older adults.\r\n3. The American Medical Association promotes the art and science of medicine and the betterment of public health.\r\n4. The National Institute on Aging has programs to promote wellness and quality of life in older adults.\r\n5. The AHA publishes the scientific guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care, which form the foundation of lifesaving protocols used by health-care professionals, companies, and hospitals in the United States and throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Mr. Fekjar is diagnosed with unstable angina. Which of the following is a contraindication for exercise therapy and prevents patients from joining an exercise program?\r\nSelect all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Uncontrolled hypertension\r\n2. Fibromyalgia\r\n3. Unstable aortic aneurysm\r\n4. Chondromalacia\r\n5. Hypoxemia - 10. Answer: 1, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Uncontrolled hypertension is a medical contraindication for exercise therapy.\r\n2. Fibromyalgia is a condition in which exercise therapy is useful for health promotion.\r\n3. Unstable aortic aneurysm is a medical contraindication for exercise therapy.\r\n4. Chondromalacia is an orthopedic condition in which exercise therapy is useful for health promotion.\r\n5. Low oxygen saturation or hypoxemia is a below-normal level of oxygen in the blood, specifically in the arteries. Hypoxemia is a sign of a problem related to breathing or circulation, and may result in various symptoms, such as shortness of breath and dizziness during exercise. Though it is not a contraindication for exercise therapy, its symptoms could be a barrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Which of the following may be included in the healthy lifestyle counseling during the initial\r\nWelcome to Medicare visit? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Level of physical activity assessment.\r\n2. Physical therapy consultation.\r\n3. Referral to an herbalist.\r\n4. Referral to a health coach.\r\n5. Referral to an acupuncturist. - 11. Answer: 1, 2, 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1 Current level of physical activity is assessed during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.\r\n2. Physical therapy consultation may be recommended for patients with disabilities or functional limitations.\r\n3. Referral to an herbalist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.\r\n4. Referral to a health coach may be recommended to patients during the initial Welcome to Medicare visit to keep them engaged.\r\n5. Referral to an acupuncturist is not part of the initial Welcome to Medicare visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Incorporating exercise into patients' lifestyles can be effectively achieved by including which of the following in your discussions with patients? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Talking about the importance of exercise.\r\n2. Encouraging goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient.\r\n3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home.\r\n4. Informing the patient about resources that are available in the community for group exercise.\r\n5. Giving an illustration of the exercises. - 12. Answer: 2, 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Handing a program or exercise prescription to the patient is more effective than just talking about it.\r\n2.Goal setting and self-monitoring by the patient is very effective in persuading the patient to adopt a healthy lifestyle.\r\n3. Recommending the purchase of exercise equipment to use at home may not be the best approach for different reasons, such as financial ability.\r\n4. Informing patients about the resources that are available in the community for group exercise is a valuable adjunct to counseling.\r\n5. Though not listed as something that could promote exercise, giving the patient illustrations for the exercise could be helpful when it is demonstrated and explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. The goal of increasing physical activity is to promote a healthy lifestyle. Which of the following options help reduce the risk of injuries? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Choosing physical activities that are appropriate for their current fitness level and health goals.\r\n2. Remaining under the care of a health-care provider if they have chronic conditions or symptoms.\r\n3. Choosing to do physical activities their friends are doing.\r\n4. Enlisting spousal supervision and support.\r\n5. Hiring a personal trainer. - 13. Answer: 1, 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Choosing to do types of physical activities that are appropriate for a patient's current fitness level and health goals helps reduce the risk of injuries.\r\n2. Being under the care of a health-care provider if a patient has chronic conditions or symptoms helps reduce the risk of injuries.\r\n3. Choosing to do types of physical activities one's friends are doing is not the best option in reducing risk for injuries because of differences in physical ability or medical conditions.\r\n4. Being under the supervision of one's spouse for support is a good facilitator, but it is not the best option in reducing the risk for injures because a spouse may not understand the impact of physical activity on physical and medical conditions.\r\n5. A personal trainer may not have the proper training for more complicated conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. The AHA Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism identified patient facilitators to increasing physical activity in older adults. Which of the following is an example of patient facilitators? Select all that apply.\r\n1. Frequent contact with prescriber.\r\n2. Planned program.\r\n3. Making time.\r\n4. Purchasing new equipment.\r\n5. Ignorance of exercise. - 14. Answer: 1,2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Frequent contact with a prescriber has been seen to be a patient facilitator.\r\n2. A planned program has resulted in facilitation toward health motivation.\r\n3. Making time is a patient choice rather than a facilitator toward making changes.\r\n4. Purchasing new equipment is not an example of a patient facilitator and may not be doable for all patients.\r\n5.Ignorance of what to do is not a patient facilitator but a barrier to increasing physical activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. To perform physical activity safely and reduce the risk of injuries and other adverse events, which of the following are advisable? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Start fast to get acclimated to the activities.\r\n2. Use their instincts.\r\n3. Use appropriate protective gear.\r\n4. Follow rules and policies.\r\n5. Have an exercise \"buddy.\" - 15. Answer: 3, 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Starting fast could actually increase the possibility of injury.\r\n2.There is no guarantee that instincts are correct.\r\n3.Using appropriate protective gear is recommended to reduce the risk of injuries.\r\n4.Rules and policies are made to inform and protect, therefore, following them will help to reduce the risk of injuries.\r\n5.Having an exercise \"buddy\" may make the activity fun but will not necessarily reduce risk of injuries, especially if the buddy does not understand the concepts of exercises and physical activity physiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Mrs. Smith, 75 years old, reports that she is weak, has difficulty urinating, and is dehydrated. Although she is afebrile, the nurse conducts a thorough physical examination, including urinalysis and complete blood count (CBC). The total assessment is necessary because:\r\n1. All body systems interact, and symptoms could indicate a variety of diagnoses.\r\n2. The symptoms are vague and may be signs of aging.\r\n3. There may be other signs or symptoms more indicative of the condition.\r\n4. Mrs. Smith may not be reporting all significant information. - 1. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.The clinician must be aware that all the systems interact and, in doing so, can increase the older person's vulnerability to illness\/disease.\r\n2.The nurse must not attribute symptoms only to the aging process.\r\n3. There may be comorbidities accompanying this condition.\r\n4. Assumptions of not reporting properly may not be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A patient with renal disease has blood work drawn, and the results show an increase in serum creatinine. The nurse practitioner needs to know which of the following laboratory values before ordering medications?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CBC\r\n2. Culture and sensitivity of the urine\r\n3. Creatinine clearance\r\n4. Uric acid levels - 2. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.A CBC will not evaluate kidney function for a patient with renal disease.\r\n2.A culture and sensitivity test reflects the presence of an infection and the antibiotic to which the organism is sensitive.\r\n3. The calculation of creatinine clearance provides an estimation of renal function.\r\n4. Uric acid level is elevated in the presence of gout.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Which of the following statements is true regarding diagnostic testing?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A test is ordered for a specific purpose.\r\n2. A test is the most invasive available.\r\n3. There is no need to discuss results with the patient.\r\n4. If a test is needed, it should be ordered regardless of risk to the patient. - 3. Answer:1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The nurse practitioner should have a plan for the use of each test result value obtained.\r\n2. When considering which laboratory tests to order, it is worth remembering the doctrine primum no nnocere—first, do no harm.\r\n3. Once laboratory tests are available for review, tests results should be discussed with the patient, with abnormal test results interpreted for the aging individual and addressed with the patient and caregivers.\r\n4. Any risks involved in laboratory testing must be considered concerning the patient's clinical condition and weighed against the test's expected benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Janey, 25 years old, may experience arthritis differently than 65-year-old Mrs. Johnson because:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The body undergoes physiological changes with aging.\r\n2. A healthy body does not experience significant changes as one gets older.\r\n3. Older patients do not feel any systemic symptoms, such as malaise and weight loss.\r\n4. Even though the same joints are usually affected, age makes it feel different. - 4. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the advanced practice nurse in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.\r\n2. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may be different depending on the age of the patient.\r\n3. Younger patients may not experience constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.\r\n4. In late-onset rheumatoid arthritis, the joint involvement is more often in the larger joints.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The nurse practitioner is examining an 85-year-old man with reports of abdominal pain, weakness, and loss of appetite. Which is the most likely condition to be tested for and ruled out?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Neoplasms and carcinomas\r\n2. Partial seizure\r\n3. Sarcopenia\r\n4. Hirschsprung's disease - 5. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Certain diseases, such as neoplasms and carcinomas, are more common in the elderly, and an understanding of the epidemiology is critical in the interpretation.\r\n2.Partial seizure is more common in early old age.\r\n3. Sarcopenia is more common in early old age.\r\n4. Hirschsprung's disease is most common in infancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. For individuals over 65 years old, the most common morbidities are related to:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Heart disease, arthritis\r\n2. Respiratory problems, cancer\r\n3. Diabetes, stroke\r\n4. All of these are common morbidities. - 6. Answer: 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Heart disease is one of the common morbidities.\r\n2.Cancer is common in the general population; however, specific types are more common in the older patient.\r\n3. Diabetes is common in patients over 40 years of age.\r\n4. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined are the most common morbidities in older patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. A gerontological patient is being examined for a report of pain in the shoulder. The nurse practitioner completes a thorough systemic examination because:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Older patients with one morbidity often express difficulties in general.\r\n2. Arthritis of the shoulder is accompanied by other neurological symptoms.\r\n3. Older patients with arthritis often experience pain in lower extremities.\r\n4. The patient may not report significant signs and symptoms. - 7. Answer:1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Older patients with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis experience joint involvement more often in the larger joints, such as the shoulder, and they also experience systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and depression.\r\n2. Older patients may express symptoms in any other physical systems.\r\n3. Patients more often experience arthritis in smaller joints.\r\n4. A thorough examination will detect objective indicators.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The nurse practitioner performs a thorough systemic examination of a patient who reports diarrhea and pain in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. One possible diagnosis would be:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Hirschsprung's disease\r\n2. Pancreatitis\r\n3. Appendicitis\r\n4. Gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease (GIBD) - 8. Answer:4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Hirschsprung's disease is an obstruction of the colon in infancy.\r\n2. Diarrhea is not associated with pancreatitis.\r\n3.Appendicitis is more common in younger patients than in older patients.\r\n4. GIBD is manifested differently in a bimodal pattern.\r\n\r\n9. A 70-year-old man is seeing a nurse practitioner because he is feeling weak and dizzy. The nurse practitioner is discussing a care plan with him and makes which of the following statements? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I want to order a test for your heart to evaluate its function.\r\n2. I will perform a thorough examination of your functional abilities.\r\n3. I will order a blood sugar test to check for diabetes.\r\n4. Many older people feel this way. It is to be expected.\r\n5. I will assess you for the presence of other conditions. - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. A complete assessment will help differentiate signs of aging from disease.\r\n2. All systems interact and can affect an existing condition.\r\n3. Identifying underlying conditions will avoid undertreatment.\r\n4. Attributing symptoms to aging can contribute to depression in an older person.\r\n5. There are changes in the sympathetic response which contribute to the orthostasis and falls, as well as lack of hypoglycemic response.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. The nurse practitioner is leading a class of seniors over age 65 years and is teaching about nutritional needs. One of the men asks why, even though he eats correctly according to the standards presented, he still feels weaker than he did 10 years ago. He also wonders why he gets more infections than he used to. Which of the following are helpful answers? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I suggest that you exercise a little more than you are currently doing.\r\n2. Some people experience a decrease in reserve energy.\r\n3. For some people, the immune system weakens.\r\n4. More viruses are being spread throughout the community.\r\n5. I suggest that you see your primary caregiver for extensive testing. - 10. Answer: 2, 3, 5 , 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Improved nutrition may not be the factor affecting health of elders.\r\n2. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including lifestyle and medications.\r\n3. Many factors can influence the health of elders, including changes in the immune system.\r\n4. Viruses and other infections are not the only considerations for infections.\r\n5. Biochemical individuality is important in detecting asymptomatic abnormalities in older adults. Significant homeostatic disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests, even though all individual test results may lie within normal limits of the reference interval for the entire group.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. An older woman is seen in the ambulatory clinic for a routine checkup. The patient asks about results of her blood work compared to last year's results. How is it best for the clinician to respond? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. They are likely to be the same if you have had no diseases since then.\r\n2. Blood work results may be different just because of your aging process.\r\n3. Your results may be different because the body changes with disease and medications you are taking.\r\n4. Blood work is not a reliable indicator of health because many things can affect your health that may not show up in the results of your blood work.\r\n5. There is likely no significant difference as your body remains stable in its functioning. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Biochemical individuality variation is often much smaller than variation within the larger group.\r\n2. The aging process and decline in organ function may affect the health of elders.\r\n3. Disease, nutrition, and medications affect the health of elders.\r\n4. Although abnormal laboratory findings are often attributed to old age, rarely are they true aging changes.\r\n5. Many factors can influence laboratory value interpretation in the elderly, including the physiological changes with aging, the prevalence of chronic disease, changes in nutritional and fluid intake, lifestyle (including activity), and the medications that are taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. An elderly couple is discussing health concerns with the nurse practitioner. The couple is concerned that each of their individual blood studies show different results. One set of test results shows a significant decrease in blood sugar, but the test results of the partner does not show an equal\r\n \r\ndecrease. Their physician does not seem concerned, and the couple is wondering why. How is it best for the nurse practitioner to respond? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Studies show that each person's pattern of chemical make-up is different.\r\n2. There is no difference between one person's range of blood results and that of any other person.\r\n3. Each person's chemical make-up is the same as that of others of the same gender and age group.\r\n4. Many factors affect an individual's chemical make-up.\r\n5. Ranges of the values provided by the laboratory are correct for any age. - 12. Answer: 1, 4, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Individuals experience smaller variations in laboratory work than from the others in the same age group.\r\n2.There are wider variations of laboratory results within a group of older people.\r\n3.Laboratory values are determined by more than age and gender.\r\n4.Laboratory values may vary as a result of nutrition, activity, and emotional status.\r\n5.The reference values presented for the older adult cohort are not necessarily correct for the individual due to biochemical individuality.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Adam, 70 years old, is admitted for possible myasthenia gravis (MG). The nurse practitioner knows that MG is commonly seen in women between 20 and 40 years old. Adam, however, is experiencing an ocular form of MG, has dysphonia, and does not have any thymus abnormalities. Adam asks why the nurse is concerned about MG since he is older and this is a \"young person's disease.\" Which of the following are the best answers? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We need to assess for anything, just in case.\r\n2. Some diseases show up in two different age and gender groups.\r\n3. Older people often experience weakness, and we must rule out other conditions.\r\n4. Your insurance will cover this, and we want to rule out as much as possible.\r\n5. Signs and symptoms of illness are the same for each disease regardless of age. - 13. Answer: 2, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Ordering more tests than needed violates the principle of \"Do no harm.\"\r\n2.MG is bimodal and can be found in younger women, as well as in both men and women.\r\n \r\n3. Knowledge of the bimodality of age onset of certain disease conditions will aid the nurse practitioner in avoiding misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis due to lack of recognition.\r\n4. There should be a need for ordering a test and value attributed to the results.\r\n5. The manifestations of illness and disease in the elderly can be very different, even if the underlying pathological process is the same as in younger individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Mrs. Smith is 75 years old and has had type 2 diabetes for 30 years. She sees her nurse practitioner on a regular basis. Mrs. Smith asks the nurse practitioner why her treatment has not been changed, even though her laboratory values are seemingly out of normal range. Which of the following answers are best? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A decision to make changes must be based on a pattern and not on one set of laboratory results.\r\n2. The normal range charts are based on patients younger than 75 years.\r\n3. Currently, it is too expensive to change your treatment.\r\n4. Comparing new results with your prior results gives a more accurate picture.\r\n5. Normal values for laboratory tests differ as one gets older. - 14. Answer: 1, 4, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Blood studies are more valuable when assessing for an increase or decrease in values.\r\n2. It is not helpful to use aging as an explanation for possible abnormal results.\r\n3. If a change in treatment is appropriate, the least expensive alternative should be sought.\r\n4. Significant disturbances in the same individual may be detected through serial laboratory tests.\r\n5. The clinician must determine whether a value obtained reflects a normal aging change, a disease, or the potential for disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Mr. Adams is 90 years old. In the last few months he appears unable to comply with the health- care plan developed by the nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner considers which of the following reasons for noncompliance when updating his home care plan? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Polypharmacy\r\n2. Treatment burden\r\n3. Attending multiple appointments\r\n4. Affording complex drug regimens\r\n5. Cognitive ability only - 15. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. As a patient ages, this correlates with more medications having been ordered.\r\n2.Patients with multimorbidity are known to have a treatment burden in terms of understanding and self- care management of their conditions.\r\n3. Patients with multimorbidity are known to have a treatment burden in terms of understanding and self- care management of their conditions.\r\n4. This burden entails affording complex drug regimens.\r\n5. Though cognitive ability may be a factor, there is much more to consider when noncompliance is an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A patient asks the nurse practitioner what is meant by health promotion. Which of the following is the nurse practitioner's best response? Health promotion:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Includes activities that an individual performs proactively to increase health and well-being.\r\n2. Is a process of keeping track of immunizations.\r\n3. Includes a set of programs that help people cope with the disease.\r\n4. Includes strategies that prolong life. - 1. Answer: 1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Health promotion includes not only preventive and health-protective measures, but also actualization of one's health potential\r\n2. Immunizations are only one part of health promotion.\r\n3. Health promotion occurs before the onset of disease.\r\n4. Quality of life is the important focus of health promotion, not a prolongation of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The nurse practitioner knows that health promotion is accomplished on a broader scale by:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Maintaining current health services.\r\n2. Maintaining federal legislation regarding health care at the current level.\r\n3. Encouraging healthy lifestyle and healthy public policy formulation.\r\n4. Encouraging the advancement of alternative health therapies. - 2. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Current health policies are ever-changing to improve services for citizens.\r\n2. Federal legislation is being proposed to increase health services.\r\n3.The World Health Organization has determined that healthy lifestyle promotion works best when coupled with supportive environments, community action, and healthy public policy formation. \r\n4. This does not include preventive and health-protective measures, nor actualization of one's health potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Mr. Thomas comes in for a health examination appointment with his nurse practitioner. He asks why nurse practitioners are qualified to conduct these evaluations. Which of the following is the nurse practitioner's best response? The nurse practitioner:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Is concerned about health and not disease.\r\n2. Saves the physician time in the office.\r\n3. Can assess for minor conditions and refer to the doctor for other conditions.\r\n4. Is prepared to assess health holistically. - 3. Answer: 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The nurse practitioner is concerned about health promotion, disease prevention, and early diagnosis.\r\n2. The nurse practitioner may spend more time with the patient than the doctor is able to.\r\n3. The nurse practitioner is prepared to diagnose and plan treatment for many conditions.\r\n4.The nurse practitioner brings a holistic orientation to health and wellness development and possesses knowledge of developmental tasks and the wellness-illness continuum.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Mrs. Williams, 80 years old, asks her nurse practitioner to order a new alternative therapy for her. Mrs. Williams believes that this botanical supplement will provide pain relief for her fibromyalgia. The nurse practitioner explains that this therapy is likely not covered by Medicare because:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The botanical is expensive and not approved for use.\r\n2. Medicare only covers treatments that are approved according to the stringent guidelines of the\r\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\r\n3. There is no reason to use these botanicals when opioids are proven effective.\r\n4. This botanical is not on the Medicare list of approved medications. - 4. Answer: 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Although this botanical may not be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), its cost will depend on the distributor.\r\n2. Medicare will only pay for A and B level recommendations that meet the USPSTF stringent evidence guidelines, leaving other beneficial interventions without coverage.\r\n3. Opioids are not recommended for older patients.\r\n4. It is important to use only prescribed and approved medications\/treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. When a patient is seen by a nurse practitioner, the care plan is developed keeping which of the following objectives in mind?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Increasing the use of the emergency department for injuries from falls.\r\n2. Maintaining the patient living in his or her home.\r\n3. Increasing safety checks in the home.\r\n4. Increasing use of the Welcome to Medicare visit. - 5. Answer: 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The objective is to decrease the use of the emergency department for falls.\r\n2. There are many factors involved in the decision for an older adult to remain in the home.\r\n3. Although it is useful to conduct home safety checks, they are not part of the Healthy People 2020 objectives.\r\n4. The Healthy People 2020 program has set specific objectives for prevention in older adults; use of the\r\nWelcome to Medicare visit is one of those objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The focus of advanced nurse practitioners is primary care. This is defined as activities that focus on:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Preventing the occurrence of a disease or condition.\r\n2. Treating an illness after symptoms appear.\r\n3. Enabling the patient to recover and convalesce.\r\n4. Enriching the patient's appreciation of life. - 6. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Primary preventive strategies focus on immunization, well-checks, and other health maintenance activities.\r\n2. Secondary preventive strategies focus on prevention and treatment of illness.\r\n3. Tertiary preventive strategies focus on rehabilitation.\r\n4. Nurse practitioners focus on the wellness-illness continuum.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. A health promotion topic included in the nurse practitioner visit is physical activity. Which of the following would be a good recommendation for the 75-year-old male? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Skydiving\r\n2. Horseback riding\r\n3. Swimming\r\n4. Dancing\r\n5. Whatever the patient is willing and able to do - 7. Answer: 3, 4, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Skydiving is risky for older patients who may have cardiovascular issues.\r\n2. Horseback riding could be risky for an older person who may have neurological or orthopedic issues.\r\n3. Swimming is a good option if the patient is willing.\r\n4. Dancing is a good option if the person is able.\r\n5. When recommending physical activity, the person's functional abilities and desires need to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Understanding that the current life expectancy is 79 years, the nurse practitioner plans a patient's health promotion while considering which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Patient's health beliefs and goals.\r\n2. Present levels of function.\r\n3. Benefit of treatment.\r\n4. Patient's involvement in a religious community.\r\n5. Primary disease or condition affecting the patient. - 8. Answer: 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The nurse practitioner develops a collaborative plan that includes consideration of the patient's health beliefs and goals.\r\n2. The nurse practitioner considers present and anticipated levels of function.\r\n3. Risks need to be considered in light of benefits offered by interventions.\r\n4. The nurse practitioner may consider whether the patient is connected to a religious community but cannot prescribe or recommend any specific plan.\r\n5. Many disorders in older adults encompass multiple risk factors that involve several systems and interventions to achieve outcomes; this presents a challenge when measuring and synthesizing evidence, and reporting outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. As the nurse practitioner is teaching about the need for more exercise, the patient says that it takes away too much energy needed for other activities. The nurse practitioner explains that the benefits of exercise include which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Increased flexibility.\r\n2. Increased muscle mass.\r\n3. Maintenance of optimal weight.\r\n4. Lower blood pressure.\r\n5. Decreased urinary output. - 9. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.The health benefits of regular physical activity are well documented and include flexibility.\r\n2. Exercise increases muscle tone and mass.\r\n3. Exercise uses calories from stored fat and allows for weight loss.\r\n4. Exercise strengthens the cardiac muscle and thereby lowers blood pressure.\r\n5. Exercise does not affect urinary output.\r\n \r\n10. While counseling a patient about physical activity, the nurse practitioner considers which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A physical activity prescription that is individualized to the patient.\r\n2. Active hobbies that the patient enjoys.\r\n3. Alternative activities such as yoga or tai chi.\r\n4. Armchair activities for the frail older adult.\r\n5. Patient's ability to pay for involvement in activities. - 10. Answer: 1, 2, 3,4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Each person is unique and may not respond the same to exercise.\r\n2. Hobbies are enjoyable and give pleasure, while at the same time increasing activity.\r\n3. Stretching routines are done slowly and to the level of endurance.\r\n4. When the frail older person cannot ambulate, they can move other parts of their body such as core, arms, head, and neck. They may also do non-weight-bearing movements of legs and feet.\r\n5. Movement, activity, and exercise can be done anywhere, anytime the individual desires. There is no need to join a group.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Nutrition counseling is part of health promotion. The nurse practitioner considers a teaching plan that includes which of the following information? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Level of involvement in community activities.\r\n2. Baseline information on current dietary intake.\r\n3. Current activity patterns.\r\n4. Current height and weight.\r\n5. Health status information. - 11. Answer: 2, 3, 4, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Active involvement in community activities does not reflect what the older person is eating.\r\n2. The nurse practitioner needs the current state of nutrition to develop a plan for increasing or maintaining positive nutrition.\r\n3. Knowing how much activity the person has affects the need for calories and nutrients.\r\n4. Knowing the current height and weight aids in determining the body mass index, which is an indicator of normal weight or overweight.\r\n5. Before initiating counseling about diet, obtain baseline information on other health status information.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. A major concern for older adults is safety. The nurse practitioner addresses safety issues when assessing the following. Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Presence of a gun in the home.\r\n2. Fear of falling.\r\n3. Strength of the patient.\r\n4. Presence of rugs and other hazards in the home.\r\n5. Urinary incontinence. - 12. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4,5 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Possession of a firearm combined with depression, caregiver stress, irreversible illness, or decline in functional abilities can invite self-inflicted injury, suicide pacts, or other acts of violence.\r\n2. Fear of falling causes a person to walk guardedly and unevenly.\r\n3. Potential recommendations include exercise programs to build strength.\r\n4. Rugs, furniture, and pets can become obstacles for the older person to stumble over.\r\n5. Urinary incontinence, day or night, causes the person to rush to the bathroom and increases the risk of falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Albert is 72 years old and complains of burning upon urination. He has recently returned from a vacation to another country. The nurse practitioner conducts a physical examination and observes that there is a white discharge from his penis. What does the nurse practitioner include in the treatment plan? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Teaching on safe sex practices.\r\n2. Teaching about the incidence of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), even at an older age.\r\n3. Teaching that frequent testing and screening is needed if he continues to be sexually active.\r\n4. Assuring the patient that while traveling there are limited opportunities for sexual encounters.\r\n5. There is no need to assess an older patient's sexual preferences and practices. - 13. Answer: 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Older adults are less likely to practice safe sex and use condoms.\r\n2. Older people may be at increased danger from STIs because of the decreased perception of risk.\r\n3. Current sexual history may determine the need for continued screening for STIs, HPV, and cervical cancer.\r\n4. Encounters may be with fellow travelers, locals, or commercial sex workers.\r\n5. Using the patient's sexual history, explore patient needs, preferences, and medical or psychological obstacles to sexual expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Mary, 72 years old, goes to the pharmacy to pick up her prescriptions. The pharmacist asks if she has had her immunizations. Mary replies, \"I had all my childhood shots, so I do not need any now.\" What should the nurse practitioner teach her about senior immunizations? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Because the immune system may be weakened in older persons, immunizations are suggested.\r\n2. Persons over the age of 50 years should have a yearly influenza vaccine.\r\n3. The new Shingrix vaccine will help protect her from shingles.\r\n4. The side effects of immunizations outweigh the benefits of immunizations.\r\n5. The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a one-time dose. - 14. Answer: 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The older person is susceptible to organisms that cause infection due to decreased immunity, nutrition, hydration, and other factors.\r\n2. The influenza virus mutates each year and an updated version of the vaccine is needed to provide immunity. Influenza vaccine is now recommended annually for all adults over 50 years old, unless contraindicated.\r\n3. Recently released Shingrix has been found to be more effective than the Zostavax, which was given previously.\r\n4. Side effects are most often mild and localized. Viruses can cause serious or even lethal conditions.\r\n5. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended as follows: Administer one-time dose to PCV13-naïve adults at age 65 years, followed by a dose of PPSV23 12 months later.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Mr. and Mrs. Jones are preparing to take a trip to Europe. The nurse practitioner includes the following teaching about taking care of their health while gone. Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Shorter airplane flights provide more chance to ambulate and relieve pressure on the back and legs.\r\n2. Generally speaking, the air in Europe is cleaner than the air in the United States, so you should have no problems with your respiratory conditions.\r\n3. Plan to fill your prescriptions when you are in a larger city.\r\n4. Depending on the specific areas you will visit, certain immunizations may be needed.\r\n5. You will most likely function as well when traveling as when at home. - 15. Answer: 1, 4\r\n,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Long flights in cramped areas increase the risk of thromboembolic events.\r\n2. Increased air pollution is a significant problem in many countries and affects pulmonary function.\r\n3. The medications needed may not be available in some countries in Europe. Medicare does not cover medications filled outside of the United States.\r\n4. Some areas of the world continue to see cases of yellow fever, malaria, and other diseases. When going to a vulnerable area, proper immunizations are required.\r\n5. Some of the physiological and psychosocial changes that can occur with aging pose special risks during travel. How a patient functions at home may not be indicative of how well he or she will function in an unfamiliar environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both 75 years old and are seeing their nurse practitioner for their annual checkups. Mrs. Smith wonders why they each have trouble digesting different foods. It is inconvenient for her to fix different meals that they both can tolerate. The nurse practitioner explains that:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Men have more difficulty digesting vegetables.\r\n2. Women have more difficulty digesting dairy products.\r\n3. Men and women have different enzymes in their gastrointestinal tracts.\r\n4. Organ systems progress differently for each person regardless of age. - 1. Answer: 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. There are no gender differences in types of food digested.\r\n2. People of either gender may have an intolerance to dairy.\r\n3. People of either gender have the same types of enzymes in their digestive systems.\r\n4. People age at different rates, and within each person organ systems age at different rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The nurse practitioner conducts a comprehensive geriatric assessment of the older individual because:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Health of older people is affected by several factors.\r\n2. A focused assessment will provide depth of specific information.\r\n3. A comprehensive assessment will provide more subjective information.\r\n4. A comprehensive assessment will result in a list of current and prior medications taken. - 2. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. A comprehensive approach to geriatric assessment is recommended because the physical health of the older adult is inextricably related to functional ability, psychosocial health, and a safe and enabling environment.\r\n2. A focused assessment will provide a limited amount of information about the whole person.\r\n3. A comprehensive assessment will provide both objective and subjective information.\r\n4. A list of medications is only one component of a comprehensive assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The nurse practitioner knows that conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is more beneficial for which of the following groups?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. People between 60 and 70 years old.\r\n2. People over 70 years old.\r\n3. People classified as vulnerable older adults.\r\n4. People over 55 years old. - 3. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.People between 60 and 70 years old are likely to be healthy.\r\n2. People over 70 years old have a variety of levels of health.\r\n3. Vulnerable older adults and frail older adults will benefit most from a CGA because of lower physiological reserves and higher risk of iatrogenic complications.\r\n4. People over 55 years old may not be considered the appropriate age for a CGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. A family member comes into the clinician's office with her older mother, the patient. In the process of the examination, the nurse practitioner identifies the patient as \"frail older adult.\" The family member asks what that means. The nurse practitioner explains that this refers to:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Someone who is prone to pathological fractures.\r\n2. An older person already exhibiting signs of decline.\r\n3. An older person who has lost height and is under 5 feet tall.\r\n4. An older person being susceptible to infections. - 4. Answer: 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Frailty is not defined by only one symptom.\r\n2. Frailty, or signs of declining health, can occur at any age.\r\n3. Frailty is not related to the size of the patient.\r\n4. Infections can be treated at any age.\r\n\r\n5. Jane, 83 years old, comes to the clinic with her daughter for a geriatric assessment. The daughter asks about the necessity of this comprehensive assessment. The clinician explains that a CGA is a multidimensional process to:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Identify care needs and plans of care for older people.\r\n2. Acquire information about past medical conditions.\r\n3. Determine which diagnostic tests are necessary.\r\n4. Satisfy requirements of Medicare. - 5. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The CGA is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary, and diagnostic process to identify needs and plan outcomes.\r\n2. The CGA includes information from medical history, as well as the current assessment.\r\n3. The CGA helps identify diagnostics, treatments, and other plan-of-care strategies.\r\n4. The CGA is not a requirement of Medicare.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Mary Jane is seeing a nurse practitioner for a CGA and asks which parts of her life will be examined. The nurse practitioner says the domains of the CGA include:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Internal organ health.\r\n2. Social habits.\r\n3. Physical and psychological health, as well as other facets of life.\r\n4. History of family illness. - 6. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The CGA includes more than internal health.\r\n2. Learning about social habits is not the only component in determining health.\r\n3. Domains of CGA include physical health, psychological health, socio-environmental supports, mobility, functional status, and a measure of the quality of life.\r\n4. Although family health history provides information about genetics, the CGA is complete and includes current health status in several domains.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. In conducting a CGA, the nurse practitioner looks for any impairments in communication with the patient. The assessment includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Interviewing prior to the physical examination.\r\n2. Asking questions of the accompanying family member.\r\n3. Reading the history forms provided by the patient after the examination.\r\n4. Observing physical impairments. - 7. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Interviewing begins before the physical examination and continues throughout the examination.\r\n2. Permission from the patient must be obtained before discussing anything with the family member.\r\n3. When forms about the history of the patient are brought in, the nurse practitioner should review them before the examination.\r\n4. Observation alone will not provide adequate information about communication impairments.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. When an assessment is conducted, which of the following needs to be recorded when a new concern is identified? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Location and radiation.\r\n2. Quantity and quality.\r\n3. Aggravating and alleviating.\r\n4. Signs and symptoms.\r\n5. Effect on financial status. - 8. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. A comprehensive assessment includes the location and radiation of the symptom.\r\n2. A comprehensive assessment includes the quantity and quality of the symptom.\r\n3. A comprehensive assessment includes aggravating and alleviating factors.\r\n4. Associated signs and symptoms are included in a comprehensive assessment.\r\n5. Financial concerns are considered after the findings of the assessment are understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. After examining Adam, who is 79 years old, the nurse practitioner uses which of the following criteria to adjust Adam's medications? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Beers Criteria published in 1991\r\n2. Medication Appropriateness Index\r\n3. STOPP\/START Criteria\r\n4. HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications\r\n5. Hospital formulary - 9. Answer: 2, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The Beers Criteria, 1991, was revised in 2015. Other criteria were also developed to address weaknesses found in the original Beers Criteria.\r\n2. The Medications Appropriateness Test was developed to address some of the weak areas of the Beers\r\nCriteria.\r\n3. The STOPP\/START Criteria were developed to determine when medications should be added and when another might be discontinued for an older patient.\r\n4. The HHS Guide to Geriatric Medications does not guide in medication prescribing.\r\n5. Hospital formulary provides a list of medications carried within that hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. While examining John, who is 80 years old, the nurse practitioner observes that as he rises from the chair he pauses and holds on to the rail. Asking John if this happens often, he replies, \"Yes, I get lightheaded and feel like I will fall.\" The nurse practitioner decides to conduct testing for orthostatic hypotension. This test includes which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Having the patient lie down for 5 minutes, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.\r\n2. Having the patient stand and wait a minute, then measuring blood pressure and pulse.\r\n3. Having the patient jump in place for 2 minutes and then lie down.\r\n4. Having the patient breathe deeply five times and then stand up.\r\n5. Having the patient get up from his chair without using his arms, walk two to three steps, then back up to his chair and sit down. - 10. Answer: 1, 2\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.Obtaining baseline blood pressures is important to assess any changes.\r\n2. Measuring the blood pressure after John gets up will show a drop if he experiences hypostatic hypotension.\r\n3.Jumping in place is not a normal activity and is risky for older people.\r\n4.Breathing deeply does not affect blood pressure significantly.\r\n5.Mobility can be screened with the Timed Get Up and Go Test. This test involves observing for unsteadiness as the patient gets up from a chair without using the arms, walks 10 feet, turns around, walks back, and resumes a seated position.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. In conducting a physical assessment of an older person, the nurse practioner assesses which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Pulse oximetry\r\n2. Weight\r\n3. Color of hair\r\n4. Functional assessment\r\n5. Presence of pain - 11. Answer: 1, 2, 4, 5\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Pulse oximetry provides a reading of oxygen saturation for the end tissues.\r\n2. Measuring weight provides information about nutrition and fluid status.\r\n3. Hair color is not directly associated with health status.\r\n4. The ability to function for ADLs is crucial to the health of an older person.\r\n5.Pain is the fifth vital sign and provides information about underlying conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Mrs. Parsons is 75 years old and is anticipating renewing her driver's license. The nurse practitioner conducts an eye examination and is concerned to find which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Visual acuity better than 20\/20.\r\n2. Visual acuity worse than 20\/40.\r\n3. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze.\r\n4. Ability to gaze downward.\r\n5. Absence of nystagmus. - 12. Answer: 2, 3,\r\n\r\n \r\nRationale:\r\n1. An acuity of 20\/20 is normal. Better than that is good.\r\n2. Visual acuity of worse than 20\/40 suggests weakness in the ability to see.\r\n3. Abnormality in cardinal fields of gaze may indicate a neurological condition.\r\n4. Ability to gaze downward is normal.\r\n5. Abnormality in the six cardinal fields of gaze with nystagmus or lack of a downward gaze may reveal neurological disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Bertha is an 85-year-old grandmother who has multiple morbidities. Family members report that Bertha is not eating much and does not seem as active as usual. They want the nurse practitioner to order tests to identify what is happening to her. The nurse practitioner considers which of the following before ordering any tests? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Will the test results alter any of the diagnoses that she is currently addressing?\r\n2. Will the results alter management of her health regimen?\r\n3. What is the cost\/benefits ratio?\r\n4. Is the test the least invasive?\r\n5. Is this testing acceptable to the patient? - 13. Answer: 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. One of the considerations in ordering tests for diagnostic purposes is whether the test result will alter the diagnosis.\r\n2. One of the considerations in ordering tests for diagnostic purposes is whether the test result will alter management of a condition.\r\n3. The cost and benefits need to outweigh the risks.\r\n4. Less invasive testing alleviates negative reactions to invasive procedures.\r\n5. Evidenced-based practice includes the consideration of the patient's wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. In assessing functionality, the nurse practitioner first considers activities of daily living (ADLs), which include which of the following? Select all that apply.\r\n \r\n1. Basic self-care.\r\n2. Mobility.\r\n3. Continence.\r\n4. Ability to cook a meal.\r\n5. Ability to interact with others within the community. - 14. Answer: 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The ability to bathe and dress oneself is a basic daily need.\r\n2. The ability to move around and walk safely is a basic daily need.\r\n3. The ability to maintain urinary and bowel control is a basic daily need.\r\n4. It is not a basic daily need to be able to cook. It is possible to eat food that does not require cooking.\r\n5. Industrial ADLs measure community interactions within the home and outside the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. The nurse practitioner performs a holistic assessment on an older patient. One component of this assessment is spirituality. Which of these options is appropriate to use to assess any spiritual needs? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Use the HOPE assessment tool: source of Hope, a participant in an Organized religious group, Personal spirituality, Effect of spirituality on health care.\r\n2. Ask the patient, \"Are you at peace?\"\r\n3. Call a chaplain to conduct the assessment.\r\n4. Wait until a sign of distress appears and then evaluate the source.\r\n5. Administer the FICA assessment of spiritual needs. - 15. Answer: 1, 2, 5\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. HOPE is an acceptable assessment tool for spiritual distress.\r\n2. Asking a direct question that is not directed at a specific faith or religion is appropriate.\r\n3. Chaplains are helpful, but the nurse practitioner can make a basic assessment of a patient.\r\n4. An early assessment can help to avoid distress by implementing comfort measures early.\r\n5. FICA (Puchalski & Romer, 2000): Faith or belief, Importance or influence, Community Address is an acceptable assessment tool.\r\n \r\n1. Geriatric assessments can be challenging for the health-care provider due to delay of\r\nrecognition and\/or reporting of symptoms by the patient. Which of the following best describes what is used by health-care providers to address this differential?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Clinical decision-making tools.\r\n2. When symptoms were noticed.\r\n3. Change in function and impact of symptoms.\r\n4. Symptoms from comorbidities. - 1. Answer: 3\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Using clinical decision-making tools can be complicated because of different factors, such as patient denial of symptoms and their occurrences.\r\n2. Using the time symptoms were noticed as the basis for assessment cannot be deemed an effective tool due to inaccuracies regarding the report of when symptoms first occurred.\r\n3. Change in function as a measure of the impact of a symptom on the patient is an effective means of sorting out the differential.\r\n4. Comorbidities can result in a delayed or atypical presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Which of the following terms refers to conditions that have multiple underlying factors and may involve multiple organs?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Multifaceted syndrome\r\n2. Aging syndrome\r\n3. CFM syndrome\r\n4. Geriatric syndrome - 2. Answer: 4\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Multifaceted syndrome is not the correct term, although conditions reflect the many contributing aspects to health care.\r\n2. Aging syndrome is not the correct term, although aging may be a contributing factor to the condition.\r\n3. CFM syndrome is not the correct term, although conditions may have cognitive, functional, and mobility impairments.\r\n4. Geriatric syndrome is the term that refers to the conditions that have multiple underlying factors that may involve multiple organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Mrs. Rizzo is an 80-year-old Caucasian female who is presenting symptoms of chest pain, weakness, and lightheadedness. Which of the following may be a possible differential diagnosis of her\r\nsymptoms?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Ischemic colitis\r\n2. Spinal cord compression\r\n3. Diabetic neuropathy\r\n4. Costochondritis - 3. Answer: 4\r\n8, 39\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Ischemic colitis is a possible differential diagnosis for fecal incontinence.\r\n2. Spinal cord compression is a possible differential diagnosis for fecal incontinence.\r\n3. Diabetic neuropathy is a possible differential diagnosis for fecal incontinence.\r\n4. Costochondritis is the possible differential diagnosis for her symptoms of chest pain, weakness, and lightheadedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Steven is a 65-year-old male diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He is taking anti- Parkinson's drugs, calcium supplements, and NSAIDs for his joint pain. Which of the following conditions could be caused by his medications?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Constipation\r\n2. Hematuria\r\n3. Headache\r\n4. Chest pain - 4. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Anti-Parkinson's drugs, calcium supplements, and NSAIDs are all known to cause constipation.\r\n2. In older adult patients, the most common causes of hematuria are malignancy or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\r\n3. Anti-Parkinson's drugs, calcium supplements, and NSAIDs typically do not cause headaches. Headache, however, may be a signal symptom for other neurological conditions.\r\n4. Anti-Parkinson's drugs, calcium supplements, and NSAIDs typically do not cause chest pain. Chest pain may be a signal symptom for some cardiac conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Which of the following statements best describes \"cough\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It is a sign of a life-threatening condition.\r\n2. It is often isolated to the respiratory system.\r\n3. It is often isolated to the immune system.\r\n4. It is often associated with acid reflux. - 5. Answer:\r\n2 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.\r\nCough is often associated with conditions that are not life threatening.\r\n2.\r\nCough is often isolated to the respiratory system.\r\n3.\r\nCough may be a secondary symptom associated with the immune system.\r\n4.\r\nCough is unlikely to be associated with acid reflux.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Tina is a 60-year-old female presenting symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum. She is being treated with antibiotics, use of a nebulizer, and oral steroids. Which of the following conditions could be her diagnosis?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Bacterial pneumonia\r\n2. Acute bronchitis\r\n3. Chronic bronchitis\r\n4. GERD - 6. Answer: 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.\r\nHer symptoms are not typical of bacterial pneumonia, which is a common lung infection where the lungs' air sacks become inflamed. Signal symptoms may be fever as high as 105°F, along with profuse sweating, bluish lips and nails, and confusion.\r\n2.\r\nAntibiotics should not be used with acute bronchitis because it is viral.\r\n3.\r\n \r\nChronic bronchitis is a condition that presents with symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum, and is often treated with antibiotics, use of a nebulizer, and oral steroids.\r\n4.\r\nGERD is a gastrointestinal condition that may be associated with coughing but is treated with an antihistamine and decongestant.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Reduction of pain is the main goal for patients suffering from acute joint pain. The mnemonic\r\nPRICE is a helpful reminder of the treatment when this occurs. What does the \"E\" in PRICE stand for?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Elevation\r\n2. Emergency\r\n3. Elastic\r\n4. Electrical - 7. Answer: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. Elevating the joint above heart level may help reduce pain and swelling.\r\n2. This is not part of the mnemonic.\r\n3.This is not part of the mnemonic, although the \"P\" does stand for protection with a brace or wrap.\r\n4. This is not part of the mnemonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. A patient complains of dry, irritated, and itchy skin that has not been relieved with over-the-counter medications. On examination, the patient is also found to present cholestasis and jaundice. From which of the following conditions may the patient be suffering?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Lice\r\n2. Scabies\r\n3. Pruritus\r\n4. Lichenification - 8. Answer:3 \r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.\r\nLice may cause itching in the scalp but is generally localized.\r\n2.\r\nScabies may cause itching of the skin but is generally localized.\r\n3.\r\n \r\nPruritus is an unpleasant, irritating, or itching sensation on the surface of the skin that may lead to a desire to scratch. Inflammation results from activation of the immune response.\r\n4.\r\nLichenification is the result of continued scratching and causes thickening of the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Mr. Thomas noticed tremors in his right hand 2 years ago and attributed this to his elbow injury from a fall. The tremors have gradually worsened, and he now has tremors under his lip, some gait problems, and occasional stomach spasms. His wife has recently noticed these things\r\nand suggested he have a medical consultation. Which of the following reasons might Mr. Thomas have had for ignoring these symptoms? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Fear of loss of independence\r\n2. Fear of doctors\r\n3. Symptoms do not interfere with functions\r\n4. Attributes symptoms to the aging process\r\n5. Lack of transportation - 9. Answer: 1, 3,\r\n4 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.\r\nFear of loss of independence may result in older adults not seeking medical help for illnesses.\r\n2.\r\nFear of doctors is usually not a factor.\r\n3.\r\nIf symptoms do not interfere with one's ability to function, sometimes medical help will not be sought.\r\n4.\r\nIf an individual has a feeling that his symptoms are simply t","url":"www.stuvia.com\/doc\/2707350\/final-exam-nurs-6540-nurs6540-test-bank-advanced-practice-care-of-frail-elders-more-than-200-questions-and-answers-with-rationales-complete-guide-verified-20232024","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.stuvia.com\/docpics\/2707350\/e520a62768311_2707350_1200_1700.webp"},"@id":"www.stuvia.com\/doc\/2707350\/final-exam-nurs-6540-nurs6540-test-bank-advanced-practice-care-of-frail-elders-more-than-200-questions-and-answers-with-rationales-complete-guide-verified-20232024"}</script>
